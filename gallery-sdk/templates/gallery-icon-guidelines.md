# Your icon tile for the Azure Store

When onboarding a new partner to the Windows Azure Store it is very important that their offer looks polished and professional. We work very hard with each partner to simplify the display of their logo for maximum impact. To ensure that the store and offers display well, maintain consistency, and can be scaled into the next version of the developer portal, certain design standards are enforced.

Think of putting an offering in the Windows Phone store. The icons that represent those offerings are not exactly the same as the full company logo. They are an "icon" created that identifies the offering by showing a simplified view of the company logo or a new graphic created for the specific offer. We view the images that accompany WA store offerings as "logo-icons". They retain branding and logo marks that customers recognize, but discard fine details and logo text.

There are two ways that these logo-icons can be created. You can design a first pass of your own logo-icon then send a version to the Azure UX team for review, or send over an illustrator file format version of your logo along with some desired background colors and have us do the work.

These are the logo-icon requirements:

1. Select a white solid version of your logo or icon. If you do not have a reversed out version, select the version that you would use on top of a dark color or image.
1. Full color background
1. The background color must be dark enough for white text to be overlayed on top of it. (this consideration is for the next version of the portal)
1. Logo must be legible at 40x40px
1. We strongly prefer the icon to contain only a logo MARK without logo TEXT, unless that text is very short.
