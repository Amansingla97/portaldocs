# Gallery 4.9 Release Notes
Below are the updates to the gallery that are availible in Gallery 4.9 and Shell 4.9 (AUX4.10 release).

> [WACOM.NOTE] This is a future release and is subject to change.

## Enforcement of Image Sizes
Begining of this release we will enforce the size of images. If you publish images that are incorrectly sized they will likely be distorted on the client. Additionally, we are adding validation to the publishing tool to block publishing of incorrectly sized images. This is particularlly important for screenshots. Please see the [gallery item specification][gallery-item-spec] for details on image sizes.
