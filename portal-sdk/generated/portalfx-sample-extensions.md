## Samples extension

The samples extension provides an individual sample for each feature available in the framework.

After installing the MSI, the local instance of the portal will open with the samples extension pre-registered.  You can open the solution file for the extension to view how specific parts of the API behave:

```bash
[My Documents]\PortalSDK\FrameworkPortal\Extensions\SamplesExtension\SamplesExtension.sln
```

If you are using IntelliMirror, you you find the samples and the portal in this location:

```bash
%LOCALAPPDATA%\PortalSDK\FrameworkPortal\Extensions\SamplesExtension\SamplesExtension.sln
```

The samples in samples extension are structured in two major categories **V1** and **V2**. The samples in V2 directories use the latest patterns.

If you make edits to the samples, you can refresh the portal to see your changes. Each sample demonstrates a single usage of the API.  It's great for detailed information on any one API.
