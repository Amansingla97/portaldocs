### When to use
Gathering text input is available via multiple controls, choose the one most suited to your needs
* **CopyableLabel** - multi-line text input with built-in support for infoBalloonContent and an easy way for user to copy value.
* **NumericTextBox** - restricts input to numbers only and built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText
* **PasswordBox** - text input that uses a * character instead of echoing user input with built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText.  Use PasswordBox for security sensitive fields.
* **TextBox** - single-line text input with built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText
* **MultilineTextBox** - multi-line text input with built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText

* When part of a form, provide clear designations for which fields are required vs. optional.
