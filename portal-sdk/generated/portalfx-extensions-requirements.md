## Requirements for Azure Services

All services using Azure Billing must be exposed by using the Azure Resource Manager (ARM). Services that do not use Azure Billing can use either ARM or Microsoft Graph. Usually, services that integrate deeply with Office 365 use Graph, while all others are encouraged to use ARM. 
 
For more information about ARM API, see Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API Reference, located at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customer-insights/ref/armapiref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customer-insights/ref/armapiref), and also see Resource Manager REST APIs, located at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-rest-api](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-rest-api).

For more information about onboarding with Microsoft Graph, see [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/azure_ad_overview](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/azure_ad_overview).

The Azure portal SDK doesn't require any specific back-end, but does provide extra support for ARM-based resources. 

All new services should be listed in the Azure Web site that is located at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com). This isn't a requirement for onboarding the portal, but service categorization is the same between the azure.com Products menu, portal Services menu, and the Azure Marketplace. The service should not be listed in the portal unless it is also on azure.microsoft.com.
