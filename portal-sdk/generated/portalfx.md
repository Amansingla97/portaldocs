Azure Portal is a single page web application. The parts of the page in the Portal are loaded by referencing web applications, known as extensions, that are dynamically accessed based on a customer’s action on the Portal. For example, when a customer clicks on virtual machine icon then the Portal will automatically load Virtual Machine management extension. 

Partners can instantaneously gain access to Azure Portal’s large customer base by developing and registering extensions that provide unified and consistent look and feel.  

The success of Azure Portal is dependent on the success of our partners. For our partners to succeed we provide them access to necessary tools and an ecosystem where they can seek help and collaborate. 

**Extension developers** can leverage Azure Portal SDK and extension hosting service to rapidly develop and ship extensions. Also, Azure Portal has a strong developer community to help you build the extensions. 

**Program / Product Managers** can gather deeper understanding of extension’s health and customer behavior using the Power BI reports and Kusto telemetry.
