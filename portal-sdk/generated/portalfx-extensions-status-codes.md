## Status Codes and Error Messages

Status codes or error messages that are encountered while developing or supporting an extension may be dependent on the type of extension that is being created, or the development phase in which the message is encountered.  Terms that are encountered in the error messages may be defined in the [Glossary](portalfx-extensions-glossary-status-codes.md).

<!-- TODO:  Find at least one status code for each of these conditions. -->
 
* * *

The following errors may be encountered during different phases of extension development and maintenance.  Error states that are specific to performance are located at [#error-states](#error-states).

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-err_insecure_response"></a>
### ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE

ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE in the browser console

***My Extension fails to sideload and I get an ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE in the browser console***.
   
![alt-text](../media/portalfx-productiontest/errinsecureresponse.png "ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE Log")

ERROR: the browser is trying to load the extension but the SSL certificate from localhost is not trusted.

SOLUTION: Install and trust the certificate.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-failed-to-initialize"></a>
### Failed To Initialize

ERROR: The extension failed to initialize. One or more calls to methods on the extension's entry point class failing.

SOLUTION: Scan all the relevant error messages during the timeframe of the failure. These errors should have information about what exactly failed while trying to initialize the extension, e.g. the initialize endpoint, the getDefinition endpoint, etc.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-first-response-not-received"></a>
### First Response Not Received

ERROR: The shell loaded the extension URL obtained from the config into an IFrame; however there wasn't any response from the extension.

SOLUTION: 

1. Verify that the extension is correctly hosted and accessible from the browser.

1. The extension should have code injected in the  `layout.cshtml` which includes a postMessage call. Verify that this code gets executed.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-form-improperly-allows-edits"></a>
### Form improperly allows edits

*** Error: Form should not allow edits until an EditScope is loaded***

ERROR:

This error is commonly the result of making an observable change to `EditScope` data that is not due to the user making edits in the UI.   For example, establishing default values by writing to `EditScope` observables when a viewModel is initializing might cause this error.

SOLUTION: 

Extensions should use the `mapIncomingDataForEditScope` option when instantiating `ParameterProvider`, in order to establish initial values in the `EditScope`.

* * *

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-definition"></a>
### Invalid Definition

ERROR: The definition that was received from an extension had validation errors.

SOLUTION: Scan the error logs for all the validation errors in the extension definition and fix them.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-extension-name"></a>
### Invalid Extension Name

ERROR: The name of the extension as specified in the `extensions.json` configuration file doesn't match the name of the extension in the extension manifest.

SOLUTION: Verify what the correct name of the extension should be, and if the name in config is incorrect, update it.

If the name in the manifest is still incorrect, contact the relevant extension team to update the  `<Extension>` tag in the PDL file with the right extension name and recompile.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-indicate-loaded"></a>
### Invalid Indicate Loaded

ERROR: The manifest for an extension was received at an invalid time. e.g. if the manifest was already obtained or the extension was already loaded.

SOLUTION: Report this issue to the framework team for investigation.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-manifest"></a>
### Invalid Manifest

ERROR: The manifest that was received from an extension had validation errors.

SOLUTION: Scan the error logs for all the validation errors in the extension manifest and fix them.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-internal-server-error-500"></a>
### Internal Server Error 500

ERROR: Received 500, Internal Server Error when loading the extension. The extension logs the message "*Unable to find AMD modules '_generated/Manifest'*".

SOLUTION:

1. Make sure the **JavaScript** files are embedded as resources in the extension assembly. To see embedded resources, open the assembly in Reflector or some similar tool and explore resources. It should display `<YourExtensionNamespace>/Content/ â€¦ /_generated/Manifest.js` and with similar resources, although the dots and slashes are interchangeable. 

1. If those resources are embedded, make sure the assembly contains the following attribute.

    `[assembly: AllowEmbeddedContent("<YourExtensionNamespace>")]` 
    
    This indicates that the **JavaScript** is an embedded resource with this prefix.

* * *

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-manifest-not-received"></a>
### Manifest Not Received

ERROR: The bootstrap logic was completed, however the extension did not return a manifest to the shell. The shell waits for a period of time (currently 40 seconds as of 2014/10/06) and then times out.

SOLUTION:
1. Verify that the extension is correctly hosted and accessible from the browser.

1. If the extension is using AMD modules, verify that the `manifest.js` file is accessible from the browser. Under default settings it should be present at `/Content/Scripts/_generated/manifest.js`.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-portal-error-520"></a>
### Portal Error 520

***The Portal encountered a part it cannot render***

ERROR: The Portal displays a 520 error, as in the following image.

![alt-text](../media/top-legacy-parts/failure.png "Portal Error Message")

The Web server is returning an unknown error. 

SOLUTION: Use the following troubleshooting steps.

* Check the browser console, and look for errors that describe the error condition in more detail. 
* Click on the failed part. With some types of errors, this will add a stack trace to the browser console.
* Double check the Knockout template for correct syntax.
* Ensure that all variables that are used in the template are public properties on the corresponding view model class.
* Reset the desktop state.
* Enable first chance exceptions in the JavaScript debugger.
* Set break points inside the viewModel constructor to ensure no errors are thrown.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-server-error-404"></a>
### Server Error 404

ERROR: 404, Not Found.

DESCRIPTION: The Portal's built-in data layer automatically detects HTTP 404 responses from **AJAX** calls, in order to cover the most common scenarios.  When a part depends on data and a 404 has been detected, Ibiza automatically makes the part non-interactive and displays a message of 'Not Found'.  The effect is that in most "not found" scenarios, extensions will display the more accurate 'Not found' message instead of the sad cloud UX that is reserved for unexpected errors.

This distinction allows the Portal telemetry system to differentiate between bugs and deleted assets when parts  fail to render.

SOLUTION: Extensions should allow the Portal to handle 404 responses by default. However, there are exceptions where this behavior may not be the best action.  In those cases, the extension can opt out of automatic 404 handling by setting the `showNotFoundErrors` flag to `false` when creating the extension's `dataViews`. The following code makes 404s result in rejected promises, which allows individual extensions to apply special handling.

```js
this._dataView = dataContext.createView(container, { interceptNotFound: false });
```

**NOTE**: Instances of 'Not Found' do not count against a part's reliability KPI.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-sandboxed-iframe-security"></a>
### Sandboxed iframe security

***Error: 'Security of a sandboxed iframe is potentially compromised by allowing script and same origin access'.***
 
The Azure Portal should frame the extension URL, as specified in [top-extensions-getting-started.md](top-extensions-getting-started.md) and [portalfx-extensions-key-components.md](portalfx-extensions-key-components.md).  Also see [#console-error-messages](#console-error-messages).

* * *

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-timed-out"></a>
### Timed Out

ERROR: The extension failed to load after the predefined timeout, which is currently 40 seconds.

SOLUTION: Scan the errors to see if there are any other relevant error messages during the time frame of the failure.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-too-many-bootgets"></a>
### Too Many BootGets

ERROR: The extension tried to send the bootGet message to request for Fx scripts multiple times. The error should specify the number of times it refreshed before the extension was disabled.

SOLUTION:  Scan the errors to see if there are any other relevant error messages during the time frame of the failure.

* * * 

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-too-many-refreshes"></a>
### Too Many Refreshes

ERROR: The extension tried  to reload itself within the IFrame multiple times. The error should specify the number of times it refreshed before the extension was disabled.

SOLUTION: Scan the errors to see if there are any other relevant error messages during the time frame of the failure.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-unknown-entity-typed-object-array"></a>
### UNKNOWN ENTITY-TYPED OBJECT ARRAY

***Error: "Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope..."***

DESCRIPTION: After an `EditScope` is initialized and loaded, entities can be introduced and removed from the `EditScope` only by using `EditScope` APIs. Unfortunately, extensions cannot make an observable change to add or remove 'entity' objects from the `EditScope`. If an extension tries to make an observable change that introduces an 'entity' object into the EditScope, they will encounter this error. For any object residing in the `EditScope`, merely adding and removing keys cannot be detected by `EditScope` or by the FX at large and, consequently, edits cannot be tracked. When an extension attempts to add or remove keys from an `EditScope` object, this puts the `EditScope` edit-tracking in an inconsistent state.

SOLUTION: To correctly add or remove 'entity' objects, use the API's that are specified in 
[top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays](top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays).
 It is good practice to use only observable changes and `EditScope` APIs to mutate/change the EditScope/Form model.   A partial list is as follows.

* `applyArrayAsEdits`: This API accepts a new array of 'entity' objects. The `EditScope` will diff this new array against the existing `EditScope` array items, determine which 'entity' objects are created/updated/deleted, and then records the corresponding user edits.

* `getCreated/addCreated`: Addes new, 'created' entity objects to an `EditScope`.

* `markForDelete`: Marks 'entity'  objects in an `EditScope`  for deletion.

DESCRIPTION: Often, extensions encounter this error because the data is modeled  as 'entities' binding with an editable grid in a `ParameterProvider` Blade as specified in [top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays](top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays).  The error may also be encountered when applying the array edits in a corresponding `ParameterCollector` Blade. 

SOLUTION:  Here are two schemes that can be used to avoid this error.

* Use the `applyArrayAsEdits` to commit array edits to an `EditScope`.

* Define type metadata for this array twice. One copy is for array items typed as 'entities', and is used to edit the data in an editable grid. The other copy is for array items typed as not 'entities', and is used to commit data to an `EditScope` in the `ParameterCollector` blade.

### Extension Error States

Correlate the error state with the action items to see the guided next steps.

| Error state  | Definition | Action items |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
|  FirstResponseNotReceived |  The shell loaded the extension URL obtained from the config into an IFrame, however there wasn't any response from the extension |  * Scan the events table to see if there are any other relevant error messages during the time frame of the alert. <br> * Next, try opening the extension URL directly in the browser - it should show the default page for the extension. <br>* Open the dev tools network tab in your browser and try opening the extension URL appending the following query string parameter sessionId=testSessionId - this should open a blank page and all requests in the network tab should be 200 or 300 level responses (no failures). If there is a server error in the extension - it will print out the error and a call stack if available. In case the failures are from a CDN domain, check if the same URL is accessible from the extension domain - if so, the CDN might be corrupt/out of sync. In this case, flushing the CDN would mitigate the issue. |
|  HomePageTimedOut |  The index page failed to load within the max time period  |  // Need steps to action on |
| ManifestNotReceived |  This error state means that the bootstrap logic was completed, however the extension did not return a manifest to the shell. The shell waits for a period of time and then timed out. |   *              Open the dev tools network tab in your browser and try opening the extension URL appending the following query string parameter sessionId=testSessionId - this should open a blank page and all requests in the network tab should be 200 or 300 level responses (no failures).

|  InvalidManifest |             This error state means that the manifest that was received from an extension was invalid, i.e. it had validation errors | Scan the error logs for all the validation errors in the extension manifest. |
| InvalidDefinition |           This error state means that the definition that was received from an extension was invalid, i.e. it had validation errors |             Scan the error logs for all the validation errors in the extension definition. |
| FailedToInitialize |             This error state means that the extension failed to initialize one or more calls to methods on the extension's entry point class failing |  *              Look for the error code and if it is present the call stack in the  message to get more details. <br>* Then, scan the events table to get all the relevant error messages during the time frame of the alert.  <br> *        These errors should have information about what exactly failed while trying to initialize the extension e.g. the initialize endpoint, the getDefinition endpoint, etc. |

<a name="reliability-error-states-blade-error-states"></a>
### Blade  Error States

Correlate the error state with the action items to see the guided next steps.

| Error reason | Definition | Action items |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| ErrorInitializing | The Portal failed to initialize the blade due to an invalid definition. | Verify the PDL definition of the given blade. Verify the source opening the blade is passing the correct parameters. Reference a sample session in the ClientEvents kusto table there should be correlating events before the blade failure. |
|  ErrorLoadingExtension | The extension failed to load and therefore the blade was unable to load.   | Refer to the guidance provided for extension reliability  |
|  ErrorLoadingDefinition |     The FX was unable to retrieve the blade defintion from the Extension.   |       Reference a sample session in the ClientEvents kusto table there should be correlating events before the blade failure  |
| ErrorLoadingExtensionAndDefinition |            The FX was unable to retrieve the blade defintion from the Extension. |             Reference a sample session in the ClientEvents kusto table there should be correlating events before the blade failure |
|      ErrorUnrecoverable |              The FX failed to restore the blade during journey restoration because of an unexpected error. |         This should not occur but if it does file a [shell bug](http://aka.ms/portalfx/shellbug). |

### Part Error States

Correlate the error state with the action items to see the guided next steps.

| Error reason | Definition | Action items |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| TransitionedToErrorState  |         The part was unable to load and failed through its initialization or OnInputsSet  |          Consult the any_details column, there should be sample message explaining explicitly what the issue was. Commonly this is a nullRef. |
|      ErrorLocatingPartDefinition |    The FX was unable to determine the part definition. |   The likely cause of this is the extension has removed the part entirely from the PDL, this is not the guided pattern.
            See deprecating parts for the explicit guidance. __NEED LINK__ |
|  ErrorAcquiringViewModel |  The FX was unable to retrieve the part view model from the Extension. |        You can correlate the start of thesample message with one of the below for common explanations. <br> *        ETIMEOUT - This may be caused by a flooding of the RPC layer. <br> *                      Script error - Dependent on the exact message, this may be due to timeouts/latency issues/connection problems. <br> *   Load timeout for modules - This may be caused by a slow or loss of connection. <br> *    description: - This is generic bucket, here the message will define the issue further. For example if there were null references<br>              For all the above if enough information was not provided via the message explore the raw events function or reference a sample session in            the ClientEvents kusto table as there should be correlating events before the failure.             |
|        ErrorLoadingControl |  The FX was unable to retrieve the control module. |  Reach out to the FX team if you see a large amount of these issues. |
|  ErrorCreatingWidget |   The FX failed to create the widget. |   Check the sample message this is indicate the explicit reason why it failed, this was probably a ScriptError or failure to load the module. |
|  OldInputsNotHandled |        In this case a user has a pinned representation of a old version of the tile. The extension author has changed the inputs in a breaking fashion. | If this happens you need follow the guided pattern. __NEED LINK__ |
