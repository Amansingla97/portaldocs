## Status Codes and Error Messages
Status codes or error messages that are encountered while developing an extension may be dependent on the type of extension that is being created, or the development phase in which the message is encountered.  Terms that are encountered in the error messages may be defined in the [Glossary](portalfx-extensions-status-codes-glossary.md).
<!-- TODO:  Find at least one status code for each of these conditions. -->

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-failed-to-initialize"></a>
### Failed To Initialize

ERROR: The extension failed to initialize. One or more calls to methods on the extension's entry point class failing.

SOLUTION: Scan all the relevant error messages during the timeframe of the failure. These errors should have information about what exactly failed while trying to initialize the extension, e.g. the initialize endpoint, the getDefinition endpoint, etc.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-first-response-not-received"></a>
### First Response Not Received

ERROR: The shell loaded the extension URL obtained from the config into an IFrame; however there wasn't any response from the extension.

SOLUTION: 

1. Verify that the extension is correctly hosted and accessible from the browser.

1. The extension should have code injected in the  `layout.cshtml` which includes a postMessage call. Verify that this code gets executed.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-definition"></a>
### Invalid Definition

ERROR: The definition that was received from an extension had validation errors.

SOLUTION: Scan the error logs for all the validation errors in the extension definition and fix them.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-extension-name"></a>
### Invalid Extension Name

ERROR: The name of the extension as specified in the `extensions.json` configuration file doesn't match the name of the extension in the extension manifest.

SOLUTION: Verify what the correct name of the extension should be, and if the name in config is incorrect, update it.

If the name in the manifest is incorrect, contact the relevant extension team to update the  `<Extension>` tag in the PDL file with the right extension name and recompile.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-invalid-indicate-loaded"></a>
### Invalid Indicate Loaded

ERROR: The manifest for an extension was received at an invalid time. e.g. if the manifest was already obtained or the extension was already loaded.

<a name="status-codes-and-error-messages-manifest-not-received"></a>
### Manifest Not Received

ERROR: The bootstrap logic was completed, however the extension did not return a manifest to the shell. The shell waits for a period of time (currently 40 seconds as of 2014/10/06) and then times out.

SOLUTION:
1. Verify that the extension is correctly hosted and accessible from the browser.

1. If the extension is using AMD modules, verify that the `manifest.js` file is accessible from the browser. Under default settings it should be present at `/Content/Scripts/_generated/manifest.js`.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-debugging/failure.png "Portal Error Message")

The Web server is returning an unknown error. 

SOLUTION: Use the following troubleshooting steps.

* Check the browser console, and look for errors that describe the error condition in more detail. 
* Click on the failed part. With some types of errors, this will add a stack trace to the browser console.
* Double check the Knockout template for correct syntax.
* Ensure that all variables that are used in the template are public properties on the corresponding view model class.
* Reset the desktop state.
* Enable first chance exceptions in the JavaScript debugger.
* Set break points inside the viewModel constructor to ensure no errors are thrown.
