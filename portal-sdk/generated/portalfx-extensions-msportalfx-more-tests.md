### Detect Styling or layout regression\

To detect styling or layout regressions in your tests, use the `portal.detectStylingRegression` function.

    ```ts
    import testFx = require('MsPortalFx-Test');
    ...
    it("Can do action X", () => {    
        // Your test goes here, dummy test follows...
        return testFx.portal.goHome().then(() => {
            return testFx.portal.detectStylingRegression("MyExtension/Home");
        });
    });
    ```
    
The function will upload a screenshot to the `cicss` container of the storage account with the name, key, subscription id and resource group that you specify, as in the folllowing sample
 config.json:

```
    "CSS_REGRESSION_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME":"myaccountname",
    "CSS_REGRESSION_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_SUBSCRIPTIONID":"mysubscriptionid",
    "CSS_REGRESSION_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_RESOURCE_GROUP":"mygresourcegroupname",
    "CSS_REGRESSION_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY":"myaccountkey",
```

Put the storage account key into Windows Credential Manager using cmdkey i.e

```
    cmdkey /generic:CSS_REGRESSION_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY /user:myaccountname /pass:myaccountkey
```

The screenshot will then be compared with a Last Known Good screenshot and, if different, a diff html file will be produced and uploaded to your storage account.
The link to that html file will be in the failed test's error message and includes a powershell script download to promote the Latest screenshot to Last Known Good.
The initial Last Known Good file is the screenshot taken when there was no Last Known Good screenshot to compare it to; i.e. to seed your test, just run it once.
    
For reference, here's the signature of the `portal.detectStylingRegression` function.
    
    ```ts
    ...
    
    /**
     * Takes a browser screenshot and verifies that it does not differ from LKG screenshot;
     * contains an assert that will fail on screenshot mismatch
     * @param uniqueID Test-specific unique screenshot identifier, e.g. "MyExtension/ResourceGroupTagsTest"
     * @returns Promise resolved once styling regression detection is done (so you can chain on it)
     */
    public detectStylingRegression(uniqueID: string): Q.Promise<void> {
        
    ```
