# TabControl

 
<a name="basics"></a>
### Basics
The TabControl control and related tabs pattern are used for navigating frequently accessed, distinct content categories. TabControls allow for navigation between two or more content views and rely on text headers to articulate the different sections of content.

Tapping on a tab item header navigates to that header's section content.
