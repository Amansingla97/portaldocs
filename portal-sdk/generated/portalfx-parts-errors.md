### Handling part errors

Occasionally while loading parts, an extension may encounter an unrecoverable error. In that case, the part may be placed into a failure state, as in the following image.

Parts should only be placed into a failed state if there was a system fault and no action can be taken by the user to correct the error. If the user can correct the error, then the extension should display guidance about the error, as in the  example located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Lifecycle\ViewModels\PartLifecycleViewModels.ts`, and in the following code.

```ts
constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainer, initialState: any, dataContext: DataContext) {
    container.fail(SamplesExtension.Resources.Strings.failedToLoad);
}
```

When the error is  fixed,  then the extension can call `container.recover()` to return the part to its normal display state. One example is that the extension is polling for data, and the first poll does not retrieve results, but a subsequent poll returns valid results.

## Handling assets that no longer exist

Many parts represent assets like ARM resources that can be deleted from the UI, PowerShell, or the calling REST APIs.  A stateless UI system handles this deletion by loading only assets that exist at the time the UI starts up.  Because Ibiza contains the state for all user customizations, this 'Not Found' case is handled in a few specific places. Some examples are as follows.

* A VM part that was pinned to the startboard represents an asset that no longer exists

* The CPU chart for a VM part that was pinned to the startboard depends on information provided by an asset that no longer exists

If this is the case, see [portalfx-extensions-status-codes.md#server-error-404](portalfx-extensions-status-codes.md#server-error-404).

**NOTE**: Instances of 'Not Found' do not count against a part's reliability KPI.
