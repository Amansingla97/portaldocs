# Feature Flags


<a name="feature-flags-overview"></a>
## Overview
    
There are three types of query string flags that are used with extensions to modify run-time behavior. The purpose of each type of flag is similar but not identical. The Azure Portal makes use of flag values by making modifications to the server or browser, to the shell, and to the extension at runtime. Portal query string flags can be differentiated by the naming convention that is used to invoke them.

* Some feature flags have their own names, like  `https://portal.azure.com/?<featureName>=<value>`

* Most feature flags are invoked with the  syntax: `https://portal.azure.com/?feature.<featureName>=true`

* Otherwise, flags are directives to the extension, in which case the syntax is `<extensionName>_<extensionFlag>=<value>`

**NOTE**: Features that are invoked through `extensiondefinition` are outside of the scope of this document. For more information about using `extensiondefinition`, see `Microsoft.Portal.Framework.ExtensionDefinition` class.

The following table specifies the types of query string flags that are used with the Azure Portal.

| Flag               | Purpose | Document | 
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| Trace mode         | Temporarily set server characteristics, toggle a behavior, or enable event logging. For the most part, trace mode does   not require changes to extension code. The exception is certain types of logging, as specified in [portalfx-logging-from-typescript-and-dotnet.md](portalfx-logging-from-typescript-and-dotnet.md). <br> Invoked with  `https://portal.azure.com/?trace=<settingName>`.   | [portalfx-extensions-flags-trace.md](portalfx-extensions-flags-trace.md) |
| Extension Flags | Allow developers to specify features that they maintain. <br>Invoked with `https://portal.azure.com/?<extensionName>_<extensionFlag>=<value>`.   |  [portalfx-extensions-flags-extension.md](portalfx-extensions-flags-extension.md)  |
| Shell flags        | Connect the developer's extension to features that are maintained by the Azure Portal team. Shell features do not require changes to the code in the developer's extension.<br> Invoked with  `https://portal.azure.com/?feature.<featureName>=<value>`.   |  [portalfx-extensions-flags-shell.md](portalfx-extensions-flags-shell.md) |
  
<!-- The following sentence is from portalfx-domain-based-configuration-pattern.md. -->
  Changing the default feature flags that are sent to the extension requires Shell configuration changes and redeployment.

| API contract | An agreement between two pieces of code as to how to pass parameters between them, and how those parameters are processed. |
| CDN                 | Content delivery network | 
| CI infrastructure   | | 
| curation            | The process of categorizing content around a specific topic or area of interest. Curated items often formed into various types of collections and are displayed together according to theme or purpose. | 
| diagnostic switch  | |
| DOM                | Document Object Model |
| feature flag       | A coding technique that allows the enabling or disabling of new code within a solution. It allows the testing and development-level viewing of new features, before they are complete and ready for private preview.  |
| IRIS               | | 
| manifest caching | | 
| marketplace | | 
| MVC                | Model-View-Controller, a methodology of software organization that separates the view from the data storage model in a way that allows the processor or a controller to multitask or switch between applications or orientations without losing data or damaging the view.|
| NPS popups         | Net Promoter Score | 
| ProxiedObservables | | 
| query string       | The part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that contains data. Query strings are generated by form submission, or by being entered into the address bar of the browser after the URL. The  query string is specified by the values following the question mark (?). The values are used in Web processing, along with the path component of the URL. Query strings should not be used to transfer large amounts of data.  |

| web worker | A way to for extensions to run scripts in background threads. |
