## Introduction

The Azure Portal is a single page application which can dynamically load a collection of extensions. Extensions are simply web applications written using the Azure Portal SDK. These extensions are loaded in the Azure Portal via an IFrame. This allows extensions to load content securely in an isolated context.

The iFrames are loaded based on customer actions in the Portal. For example, when a customer clicks on the `virtual machine` icon then the Portal will automatically load the Virtual Machine management extension. 

Partners can instantaneously gain access to Azure Portal’s large customer base by developing and registering extensions that provide a unified and consistent look and feel.  

The success of Azure Portal is dependent on the success of our partners. For our partners to succeed we provide them access to the necessary tools and an ecosystem where they can seek help and collaborate. 

**Extension developers** can leverage the Azure Portal SDK and extension hosting service to rapidly develop and ship extensions. Also, Azure Portal has a strong developer community to help build the extensions. 

**Program / Product Managers** can gather deeper understanding of extension’s health and customer behavior using the Power BI reports and Kusto telemetry.
