| Term                              | Meaning |
| ---                               | --- |
| AMD                               | Asynchronous Module Definition |
| API                               | Application Programmer Interface |
| ARM                               | Azure Resource Manager | 
| asynchronous module definition    | A JavaScript API that specifies a mechanism that defines code modules and their dependencies in order to load them asynchronously. |
| CLI                               | Command Line Interface |
|  COR | Cross-origin resource. A mechanism that defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether or not it is safe to allow the cross-origin requests to be served.  For example, restricted resources, like  fonts,  may be requested from domains outside the domain from other resources are served. It may use additional HTTP headers to allow users to gain permission to access selected resources from a server on a different origin. | 
| extension                         | A Web application that was developed using the Azure Portal SDK and is made available to users through the Azure Portal. |
| MVVM                 | Model-View-View-Model methodology.  A  method of software organization that separates the view from the data storage model, but depends on intelligence in the view or in the data objects so that there is no controller module that needs to process or transfer information.  The controller's function is handled instead by the device operating system or by the server that is communicating with the application. This methodology allows the application to multitask, call other functions that are located on the device, or switch between orientations without losing data or damaging the view. |
| live tile                         | An object that displays information that are useful at a glance without opening an app. |
| PDL | Program Definition Language |
| SDK                               | Software Development Kit |
| single page application           | A web application or web site that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. | 
| UI                                | User Interface |
| UX                                | User Experience |
