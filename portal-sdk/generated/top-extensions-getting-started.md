<a name="setting-up-for-azure-portal-development-getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

The following procedure specifies how to set up a developer computer for Azure extension development.
   
1.  Your computer should have the most recent editions of operating systems and other software installed, as specified in [portalfx-software-install-minimum.md](portalfx-software-install-minimum.md).

1. Build an empty extension, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-create-blank-procedure.md](portalfx-extensions-create-blank-procedure.md).

1. Build a Hello World extension, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-helloWorld.md](portalfx-extensions-helloWorld.md).

1. Samples are part of the downloaded SDK, and the  DOGFOOD (DF) environment displays working copies of the samples. Browse through the samples that are located at [portalfx-extensions-samples.md](portalfx-extensions-samples.md) to explore live examples of APIs.

For more information about key components of an extension, see [portalfx-extensions-key-components.md](portalfx-extensions-key-components.md).
