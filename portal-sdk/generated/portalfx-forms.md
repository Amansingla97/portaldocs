# Developing Forms

The Azure SDK includes extensive support for displaying and managing user input. Forms are created using HTML templates, view models, and edit scopes. Developers can use standard HTML and **Knockout** to build their forms, in addition to the following items for which  the SDK framework includes support.

  * Labels
  * Validation, as in the following image
  ![alt-text](../media/portalfx-forms/forms.png "Forms Example") 
  * Change tracking
  * Form reset
  * Persisting edits across journeys and browser sessions
 
To develop extensions that use forms, review the following topics:

* [Developing UI Layouts](portalfx-forms-sections.md)
* [Building forms](portalfx-forms-construction.md)
* [Validation](portalfx-forms-field-validation.md)
* [Edit Scopes](portalfx-forms-working-with-edit-scopes.md)
* [Command integration](portalfx-forms-integrating-with-commands.md)

## Designing and Arranging the UI

<a name="developing-forms-designing-and-arranging-the-ui-the-section-viewmodel"></a>
### The section viewModel

While blade templates allow manual layout of controls as specific DOM elements, the generally recommended approach
is to bind a section `viewModel` into the DOM and then add control `viewModels` to the `children` observable array of the section. For example, the following image contains two sections with varying numbers of child objects in their respective arrays.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-forms-sections/forms-sections.png "Form Section")

The section `viewModel` provides default styling for spacing and margins and is an easy way to dynamically add and remove controls.

<a name="developing-forms-designing-and-arranging-the-ui-the-customhtml-control"></a>
### The <code>CustomHtml</code> control

The `CustomHtml` control can be used to author HTML in an autogenerated layout. Many extensions use these
two controls to avoid having to put much HTML in the blade template. However, placing the controls in the DOM manually is always an option if needed.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether "two controls" means the section viewModel and the customHtml control.
-->

To use a section, create a section viewMmodel and bind it into the DOM in the blade template using the `pcControl` binding handler. Then add all the controls that should be displayed into the `children` observable array of the section. This positions the controls sequentially on a blade, by default. 

The section's `style` property can be used to achieve other layouts. This includes table layouts that display controls in multiple rows and columns, as a list of tabs, or as a combination of layouts.

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

The code to create the section is located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\BasicCreate\ViewModels\Parts\FormsSampleBasicCreatePart.ts`.

The following template binds the section into the DOM, and will autogenerate the layout for all of its children.

<a name="developing-forms-loading-editing-and-saving-data"></a>
## Loading, editing and saving data

This sample reads and writes data to the server directly via `ajax()` calls. 

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment will display working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

The code for this example is associated with the 'basic form' sample. It is located at 
* `<dir>\Client\Forms\Samples\Basic\FormsSampleBasic.pdl`
* `<dir>\Client\Forms\Samples\Basic\Templates\FormSampleBasic.html`
* `<dir>\Client\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FromsSampleBasicBlade.ts`

The following code will load and save data by creating an `EditScopeCache` object and defining two functions. The `supplyExistingData` function reads the data from the server, and the `saveEditScopeChanges` function writes it back.

1. Instantiate an edit scope via a `MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeView` object. 

**NOTE**: When the data to manipulate is already on the client, you can also get an edit scope view from other data cache objects.

<!--
```typescript

let editScopeCache = EditScopeCache.createNew<WebsiteModel, number>({
    supplyExistingData: (websiteId, lifetime) => {
        return FxBaseNet.ajax({
            uri: Util.appendSessionId(MsPortalFx.Base.Resources.getAppRelativeUri("/api/Websites/" + websiteId)), // this particular endpoint requires sessionId to be in query string
            type: "GET",
            dataType: "json",
            cache: false,
            contentType: "application/json"
        }).then((data: any) => {
            // after you get the data from the ajax query you can do whatever transforms
            // you want in it to turn it into the model type you've defined
            return {
                id: ko.observable(data.id),
                name: ko.observable(data.name),
                running: ko.observable(data.running)
            };
        });
    },
    saveEditScopeChanges: (websiteId, editScope, edits, lifetime, dataToUpdate) => {
        // get the website from the edit scope
        let website = editScope.root;

        // if you need to do conversion on the data before posting to server you can do that
        // all we need to do here is turn the knockout object into json
        let serializableWebsite = ko.toJSON(website);

        this._saving(true);
        return FxBaseNet.ajax({
            uri: Util.appendSessionId(MsPortalFx.Base.Resources.getAppRelativeUri("/api/Websites/" + websiteId)),
            type: "POST",
            dataType: "json",
            cache: false,
            contentType: "application/json",
            data: serializableWebsite
        }).then(() => {
            // Instruct the EditScope to accept the user-authored, client-side changes as the new state of the
            // EditScope after the 'saveChanges' has completed successfully.
            // ('AcceptClientChanges' is the default behavior.  This promise could also be resolved with 'null' or 'undefined'.)
            return {
                action: Data.AcceptEditScopeChangesAction.AcceptClientChanges
            }
        }).finally(() => {
            this._saving(false);
        });
    }
});

```
-->

2. Transform the data to make it match the model type.

The server returns strings, but the model type that is being used  (`WebsiteModel`) is defined as:

```ts
interface WebsiteModel {
    id: KnockoutObservable<number>;
    name: KnockoutObservable<string>;
    running: KnockoutObservable<boolean>;
}
```

Therefore, the save and load of the data have to transform the data to make it match the model type.

<!-- TODO: Determine whether `Form.ViewModel` is an optional field. -->
The control view models require a reference to a `Form.ViewModel`, so we need to create a form and send the reference to the editScope to it, as in the following example.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FormsSampleBasicBlade.ts`
<!--
```typescript

this._form = new Form.ViewModel<WebsiteModel>(this._lifetime);
this._form.editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope;

```
-->

This form displays one textbox that lets the user edit the name of the website, as in the following code.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FormsSampleBasicBlade.ts`
<!--
```typescript

let websiteName = new TextBox.ViewModel(
    this._lifetime,
    this._form,
    this._form.createEditScopeAccessor(data => data.name),
    {
        label: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameLabel),
        validations: ko.observableArray([
            new FxViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameRequired)
        ]),
        valueUpdateTrigger: ValueUpdateTrigger.Input // by default textboxes only update the value when the user moves focus. Since we don't do any expensive validation we can get updates on keypress
    });

// Section
this.section = new Section.ViewModel(this._lifetime, {
    children: ko.observableArray<any>([
        websiteName
    ])
});

```
-->

The form is rendered using a section. Add all the controls that should be displayed into the `children` observable array of the section. This positions the controls sequentially on a blade, by default, so it's often an easy way to standardize the look of most forms in the Portal. An alternative to the default positioning is to manually author the HTML for the form by binding each control into HTML template for the blade.

This sample includes two commands at the top of the blade that will save or discard data. Commands are used because this blade stays open after a save/discard operation. If the blade was to close after the operation, then there would be an action bar at the bottom of the blade to use instead. 

The commands check to make sure the edit scope has been populated previous to enabling themselves via the `canExecute` label in the `ko.pureComputed` code.
<!-- TODO: Determine whether this is a label, a case, or a method. --> 
They also keep themselves disabled during save operations via an observable named `_saving` that the part maintains, as in the following code.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FormsSampleBasicBlade.ts`

<!--
```typescript

// set up save command
let saveCommand = new Toolbars.CommandButton();
saveCommand.label(ClientResources.saveText);
saveCommand.icon(FxBase.Images.Save());
saveCommand.command = {
    canExecute: ko.pureComputed(() => {
        // user can save when edit scope is dirty and we're not in the middle of a save operation
        let editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();
        let editScopeDirty = !!editScope ? editScope.dirty() : false;
        return !this._saving() && editScopeDirty;
    }),
    execute: (context: any): FxBase.Promise => {
        return this._editScopeView.editScope().saveChanges();
    }
}

// set up discard command
let discardCommand = new Toolbars.CommandButton();
discardCommand.label(ClientResources.discardText);
discardCommand.icon(MsPortalFx.Base.Images.Delete());
discardCommand.command = {
    canExecute: ko.pureComputed(() => {
        // user can save when edit scope is dirty and we're not in the middle of a save operation
        let editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();
        let editScopeDirty = !!editScope ? editScope.dirty() : false;
        return !this._saving() && editScopeDirty;
    }),
    execute: (context: any): FxBase.Promise => {
        this._editScopeView.editScope().revertAll();
        return null;
    }
}

this.commandBar = new Toolbars.Toolbar(this._lifetime);
this.commandBar.setItems([saveCommand, discardCommand]);

```
-->

Because the edit scope is being used, the save/discard commands can just call the `saveChanges()` or `revertAll()` methods on the edit scope to trigger the right action.

<a name="developing-forms-field-validation"></a>
## Field Validation

Validating input is one of the primary benefits of the forms API. Many simple and complex validators are available out of the box:

  * Required
  * Contains
  * Not Contains
  * Contains Characters
  * Not Contains Characters
  * Has Digit
  * Has Letter
  * Has Upper Case Letter
  * Has Lower Case Letter
  * Has Punctuation
  * Equals
  * Length Range
  * Min Length
  * Max Length
  * Numeric
  * Range
  * Min Value
  * Max Value
  * RegEx
  * Custom
  * Continuous Update

Validators also provide automatic error messages inside of a balloon control:

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-forms-field-validation/formValidation.png "Form Validation")

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment will display working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

For an example of each of these validators in action, view the following file in the samples:

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Validations\ViewModels\FormValidationsViewModels.ts`

Validators are added to the form objects that are available on the view model, as in the following code.

```ts
var nameTextboxOptions  = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.Options>{
      label: ko.observable(ClientResources.required),
      validations: ko.observableArray([
          new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.pleaseEnterSomeText)
      ])
  };
  this.nameTextbox  = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.ViewModel(
      this._container, this, "requiredFieldValue", nameTextboxOptions );
```



<a name="developing-forms-working-with-edit-scopes"></a>
## Working with Edit Scopes


Edit scopes provide a standard way of managing edits over a collection of input fields, blades, and extensions. They provide many common functions that would otherwise be difficult to orchestrate:

  * Track changes in field values across a form
  * Track validation of all fields in a form
  * Provide a simple way to discard all changes in a form
  * Persist unsaved changes in a form to the cloud
  * Simplify merging changes from the server into the current edit

Any user edits collected in an edit scope are saved in the browser's session storage. This is managed for extension developers by the shell. Parts or blades may request an edit scope, but the most common usage is in a blade. A blade will define a `BladeParameter` with a `Type` of `NewEditScope`. This informs the shell that a blade is asking for a new edit scope object. Within the rest of the blade, that parameter can be attached to an `editScopeId` property on any part. For an example of requesting an edit scope from PDL, view the following sample:

`\Client\Data\MasterDetailEdit\MasterDetailEdit.pdl`

```xml
<!-- Display detail blade with an edit scope. Blade consists of a form and commands.-->
<Blade Name="DetailBlade"
       ViewModel="DetailBladeViewModel">
    <Blade.Parameters>
        <Parameter Name="currentItemId" Type="Key" />
        <Parameter Type="NewEditScope" />
        <Parameter Name="formValid" Type="Output" />
    </Blade.Parameters>

    <Lens Title="SamplesExtension.Resources.Strings.masterDetailEditDetailTitle">
        <CustomPart Name="DetailPart"
                    ViewModel="DetailPartViewModel"
                    Template="{Html Source=&#039;Templates\\WebsitesDetail.html&#039;}"
                    InitialSize="HeroWideFitHeight">
        <CustomPart.Properties>
            <!-- Generated by the shell. -->
            <Property Name="editScopeId"
                      Source="{BladeParameter editScopeId}" />
            <!-- Output parameter indicating whether the form is valid. -->
            <Property Name="valid"
                      Source="{BladeParameter formValid}"
                      Direction="Output" />
            <!-- Master passes an id of object that will be used to seed the edit scope. -->
            <Property Name="currentItemId"
                      Source="{BladeParameter currentItemId}" />
        </CustomPart.Properties>
      </CustomPart>
    </Lens>
</Blade>
```

Using this method, many parts (and commands!) on the blade may all read from the same editScopeId. This is very common when a command needs to save information about a part. After passing the editScopeId into the part as a property, the view model must load the edit scope from the cloud. The data in
the edit scope will include original values and saved edits. The pattern to access inputs on a part is to use the `onInputsSet` method. For an example of loading an edit scope, view the following file in the samples:

`\Client\Data\MasterDetailEdit\ViewModels\DetailViewModels.ts`

```ts
// create a new editScopeView
constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainerContract,
            initialState: any,
            dataContext: DataContext) {
    super();
    ...
    this._editScopeView = dataContext.masterDetailEditSample.editScopeCache.createView(container);
    // Initialize editScope of the base class.
    this.editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope;
    ...
}
```

```ts
// update the editScopeView with a new id
public onInputsSet(inputs: any): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
    // Acquires edit scope seeded with an item with id currentItemId.
    return this._editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(inputs.editScopeId, inputs.currentItemId);
}
```

In the constructor, a new `MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeView` object is created from the `dataContext`. The `EditScopeView` provides a stable observable reference to an `EditScope` object. The editScopeId will be passed in as a member of the `inputs` object when the part is bound. The `valid` computed
above is using the `section` object of the form to determine if the form is currently valid (not directly related to the edit scope, but this will come up in the commands section below). The code that loads the edit scope is largely related to data loading, so the data context is the preferred location for the
code. For an example of loading an edit scope from a data context, view the following sample:

`\Client\Data\MasterDetailEdit\MasterDetailEditData.ts`

```ts
this.editScopeCache = MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeCache.create<DataModels.WebsiteModel, number>({
    entityTypeName: DataModels.WebsiteModelType,
    supplyExistingData: (websiteId: number) => {
        var deferred = $.Deferred<JQueryDeferredV<DataModels.WebsiteModel>>();

        this.initializationPromise.then(() => {
            var website = this.getWebsite(websiteId);
            if (website) {
                deferred.resolve(website);
            } else {
                deferred.reject();
            }
        });
        return deferred;
    }
});
```

The code above creates a new `EditScopeCache`, which is bound to the `DataModels.WebsiteModel` object type. The `fetchForExistingData()` method on the cache provides a promise, which informs the view model that the edit scope is loaded and available. For an example of using the edit scope within a form,
view the following sample:

`\Client\Data\MasterDetailEdit\ViewModels\DetailViewModels.ts`

```ts
private _initializeForm(): void {

        // Form fields.
        var websiteNameFieldOptions = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBoxOptions>{
            label: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameLabel),
            validations: ko.observableArray([
                new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameRequired),
                new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RegExMatchValidation("^[a-zA-Z _]+$", ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameValidation)
            ]),
            emptyValueText: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameInitial),
            labelPosition: ko.observable(MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.LabelPosition.Left)
        };

        this.websiteNameField = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox(this._container, this, "name", websiteNameFieldOptions);

        var isRunningFieldOptions = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.OptionsGroupOptions<boolean>>{
            label: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditRunningLabel),
            options: ko.observableArray([
                {
                    text: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditRunningOn),
                    value: true
                },
                {
                    text: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditRunningOff),
                    value: false
                }
            ]),
            labelPosition: ko.observable(MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.LabelPosition.Left)
        };

        this.isRunningField = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.OptionsGroup(this._container, this, "running", isRunningFieldOptions);

        var generalSectionOptions = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.SectionOptions>{
            children: ko.observableArray([
                this.websiteNameField,
                this.isRunningField
            ]),
            style: ko.observable(MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.SectionStyle.Wrapper),
        };

        this.generalSection = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.Section(this._container, generalSectionOptions);
    }
```

The code above creates a new set of form field objects which are bound to the edit scope.



<a name="developing-forms-integrating-forms-with-commands"></a>
## Integrating Forms with Commands

In most cases, editable forms are accompanied by commands which act upon those forms. There are two ways form data are made available to the command:

  * Part property bindings - a value from a part view model on a blade may be bound into the command view model
  * Edit scope loading - the editScopeId requested by the blade can be bound to a part and a command. By sharing an Id, they can act on the same object.

The most common use of part to command binding is sharing the `dirty` or `valid` properties of a form with a command view model. The command view model can choose to enable/disable save buttons based on validity, or enable/disable a discard button when edits are made. For an example of using a binding
between a part and command, view the `SaveItemCommand` class in the following sample:

`\Client\Data\MasterDetailEdit\ViewModels\DetailViewModels.ts`

```ts
this._editScopeView = dataContext.masterDetailEditSample.editScopeCache.createView(container);
this.enabled = ko.computed((): boolean => {
    // EditScopeId and currentItemId have to be already acquired, editscope dirty and the form valid to
    // command be enabled.
    return !this._editScopeView.loading() &&
        this._editScopeView.editScope() &&
        this._editScopeView.editScope().dirty() &&
        !this._editScopeView.editScope().saving() &&
        this._formValid();
});
```

In this snippet, the `enabled` property of the command is toggled based on the validity of the form. Inputs to this command include:

  * **editScopeId** \- loaded via a "NewEditScope" blade parameter
  * **currentItemId** \- loaded via a "Key" blade parameter
  * **formValid** \- loaded via the part containing a form on the blade

## Frequently asked questions

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-should-i-use-an-action-bar-or-a-commands-toolbar-on-my-form"></a>
### Should I use an action bar or a commands toolbar on my form?

It depends on the  scenario that drives the UX that is being built.

* If the form will capture some data from the user and expect the blade to be closed after submitting the changes, then use an action bar, as specified in [portalfx-ux-create-forms.md#action-bar-+-blue-buttons](portalfx-ux-create-forms.md#action-bar-+-blue-buttons). 
* If the form will edit/update some data and expect the user to make multiple changes before the blade is closed, then use commands, as specified in . 

Action Bar
The action bar will have one button that says something like "OK", "Create", or "Submit". The blade should be immediately closed automatically once the action bar button is clicked. Users can abandon the form by manually closing it by clicking the close button (the top-right 'x' button). You probably want to use a parameter provider to simplify your code; it takes care of provisioning the edit scope and closing the blade based on action bar clicks. Also alternatively, you can use an action bar with two buttons (like "OK/Cancel"), but that requires further configuration of the action bar. That's not recommended though because all the "Cancel" button will do is already there in close button, which makes it redundant.

Commands
You would normally have two commands at the top of the blade: "Save" and "Discard". The user can make edits and click "Save" to commit their changes. The blade should show the appropriate UX for saving the data and will stay on the screen after the data has been saved. The user can make further changes and click "Save" again. The user can also discard their changes by clicking "Discard". Once the user is satisfied with the changes, they can close theblade manually.

When applying EditScope to common Form scenarios, here is a quick reference with answers to frequently-asked questions.

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-my-users-see-the-discard-change-pop-up-even-when-they-ve-made-no-changes-on-my-form-blade-what-s-wrong-here"></a>
### Q: My users see the &#39;discard change?&#39; pop-up, even when they&#39;ve made no changes on my Form Blade. What&#39;s wrong here?

The EditScope '`root`' property returns an object or array that includes uses of Knockout observables (`KnockoutObservable<T>` and `KnockoutObservableArray<T>`). Any observable located within the EditScope is designed to be modified/updated **only by the user**, via Form fields that are bound to EditScope observables. Importantly, these EditScope observables *were not designed* to be modified directly from extension TypeScript code. If extension code modifies an observable *during Form/Blade initialization*, the EditScope will record this *as a user edit*, and this "accidental edit" will trigger the 'discard changes?' pop-up when the user tries to close the associated Blade.  

Rather than initializing the EditScope by programmatically modifying/updating EditScope observables, use these alternative techniques:
* If the extension uses a ParameterProvider component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the '`mapIncomingData[Async]`' callback supplied to ParameterProvider.
* If the extension uses an EditScopeCache component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the '`supplyNewData`' and '`supplyExistingData`' callbacks supplied to EditScopeCache.
* If neither of the above techniques suits the scenario, the '`editScope.resetValue()`' method can be used to set a new/initial value for an EditScope observable in a way that *is not recorded as a user edit* (although this only works for observables storing primitive-typed values).

### Q: I need to integrate my Form with an EditScope. Where do I get the EditScope from?

This varies *according to the UX design* being developed. Extensions choose between using a ParameterProvider component or EditScopeCache component as follows:

**Use ParameterProvider** for this common UX scenario:
* **Pop-up/dialog-like Form** - The Blade makes use of an ActionBar with an 'Ok'-like button that commits user edits. Here, typically, when the user commits their edits, the Blade is implicitly closed (like a conventional UI pop-up/dialog).

**Use EditScopeCache** for these common UX scenarios:
* **Save/Revert Blade** - The Blade has discrete 'Save' and 'Revert changes' commands in the Blade's CommandBar. Typically, these commands will keep the Blade open so the user can perform successive edit/save cycles in the same Blade (without closing/reopening the Form Blade).
* **Document editing** - The user can make edits to the same EditScope/Form model across *multiple parent/child Blades*. Here, the parent Blade will pass its '`inputs.editScopeId`' input to any child Blade used to edit the same model as the parent Blade. The child Blade will use this '`inputs.editScopeId`' in its call to '`editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(editScopeId)`' to fetch the same EditScope utilized by the parent Blade. Scenarios like these resemble document editing.

When using ParameterProvider, the Blade will make use of '`parameterProvider.editScope`' to access the loaded/initialized EditScope.  
When using EditScopeCache, in the view model the Blade will make use of an EditScopeView (see '`editScopeCache.createView(...)`') to load/acquire the EditScope.  
  
  
<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-form-fields-have-two-constructor-overloads-which-should-i-use-what-is-an-editscopeaccessor"></a>
### Q: Form fields have two constructor overloads, which should I use? What is an EditScopeAccessor?

Form fields require a binding to one or more EditScope observables. Extension developers configure this binding by supplying - essentially - *a path from the root* of the EditScope/Form model down to the observable to which the Form field should bind. They can do this by selecting one of the two Form field constructor variations:  

* **EditScopeAccessor** (preferred, compile-time verified) - The Form field view model constructor accepts an EditScopeAccessor, wrapping *a compile-time verified lambda* returning the EditScope observable to which the Form field should bind:

```typescript

this.textBoxSimpleAccessor = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.ViewModel(
    container,
    this,
    this.createEditScopeAccessor<string>((data) => { return data.state; }),
    textBoxSimpleAccessorOptions);

```

* **String-typed path** (discouraged, not compile-time verified) - The Form field view model constructor accepts a *string-typed path* locating the EditScope observable to which the Form field should bind:

```typescript

this.textBoxViewModel = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.ViewModel(container, this, "name", textBoxOptions);

```

The EditScopeAccessor variant here (the first variant) is preferred for a couple of reasons:  

* The supplied lambda will be compile-time verified. This code will be more maintainable when - for instance - the property names on the Form model types are changed.
* There are advanced variations of EditScopeAccessor that enable less-common scenarios like: binding *multiple* EditScope observables to a single Form field, translating Form model data for presentation to the user, etc.:

```typescript

this.textBoxReadWriteAccessor = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.ViewModel(
    container,
    this,
    this.createEditScopeAccessor<string>(<MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.EditScopeAccessors.Options<FormIntegratedFormData.FormIntegratedFormData, string>>{
        readFromEditScope: (data: FormIntegratedFormData.FormIntegratedFormData): string => {
            return data.state2().toUpperCase();
        },
        writeToEditScope: (data: FormIntegratedFormData.FormIntegratedFormData, newValue: string): void => {
            data.state2(newValue);
        }
    }),
    textBoxReadWriteAccessorOptions);

```  
  
  
<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-when-do-i-need-to-worry-about-type-metadata-portalfx-data-typemetadata-md-for-my-editscope"></a>
### Q: When do I need to worry about <a href="portalfx-data-typemetadata.md">type metadata</a> for my EditScope?

For many of the most common, simple Form scenarios, there is *no need* to describe the EditScope/Form model in terms of type metadata. Generally speaking, supplying type metadata is the way to turn on *advanced* FX behavior, in much the same way that - in .NET - developers apply custom attributes to their .NET types to tailor .NET FX behavior for the types.  

Re: EditScope and Forms, extensions supply type metadata for the following scenarios:  

<a name="editable-grid"></a>
<a name="entity-type"></a>
* **Editable grid** - Today's editable grid was developed to work exclusively with EditScope 'entity' arrays. An EditScope 'entity' array is one where created/updated/deleted array items are tracked individually by EditScope. To grant this special treatment to an array in the EditScope/Form model, supply type metadata for the type of the array items (for the `T` in `KnockoutObservableArray<T>`). In the following, the type is marked as an "entity type" and, additionally, the property/properties that constitute the entity's 'id' are specified:  

In TypeScript:

```typescript

MsPortalFx.Data.Metadata.setTypeMetadata("GridItem", {
properties: {
    key: null,
    option: null,
    value: null
},
entityType: true,
idProperties: [ "key" ]
});

```

In C#:

```csharp

[TypeMetadataModel(typeof(Person), "SamplesExtension.DataModels")]
[EntityType]
public class Person
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the SSN of the person.
    /// The "Id" attribute will be serialized to TypeScript/JavaScript as part of type metadata, and will be used
    /// by MsPortalFx.Data.DataSet in its "merge" method to merge data by identity.
    /// </summary>
    [Id]
    public int SsnId { get; set; }
    
```
  
<a name="track-edits"></a>
* **Opting out of edit tracking** - There are Form scenarios where some properties on the EditScope/Form model are not meant for editing but are - possibly - for presentation only. In this situation, the extension can instruct EditScope to *not track* user edits for such EditScope/Form model properties, like so:

In TypeScript:  

    MsPortalFx.Data.Metadata.setTypeMetadata("Employee", {
        properties: {
            accruedVacationDays: { trackEdits: false },
            ...
        },
        ...
    });  

In C#:  

    [TypeMetadataModel(typeof(Employee))]
    public class Employee
    {
        [TrackEdits(false)]
        public int AccruedVacationDays { get; set; }

        ...
    }  

Extensions can supply type metadata to configure their EditScope as follows:  

* When using ParameterProvider, supply the '`editScopeMetadataType`' option to the ParameterProvider constructor.
* When using EditScopeCache, supply the '`entityTypeName`' option to '`MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeCache.createNew`'.

To either of these, extensions pass the type name used when registering the type metadata via '`MsPortalFx.Data.Metadata.setTypeMetadata`'.  
  
  
<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-the-user-added-removed-rows-from-my-editable-grid-but-i-don-t-see-the-corresponding-adds-removes-in-my-editscope-array-what-gives"></a>
### Q: The user added/removed rows from my editable grid, but I don&#39;t see the corresponding adds/removes in my EditScope array.  What gives?

EditScope 'entity' arrays were designed with a few requirements in mind:
* The user's edits need to be serialized so that Journey-switching works with unsaved Form edits. For editing large arrays, the FX should not serialize array edits by persisting two full copies of the (could-be-large) array.
* In the UI, the FX will want to render an indication of what array items were created/updated/deleted. In some cases, array removes need to be rendered with strike-through styling.
* Array adds/remove need to be revertable for some scenarios.

The resulting EditScope design was to make EditScope 'entity' arrays behave differently than regular JavaScript arrays.  Importantly:
* 'Creates' are kept out-of-band
* 'Deletes' are non-destructive

To conveniently see the *actual* state of an EditScope 'entity' array, use the '`getEntityArrayWithEdits`' EditScope method. This returns:
* An array that includes 'created' entities and doesn't include 'deleted' entities
* Discrete arrays that individually capture 'created', 'updated' and 'deleted' entities  

This '`getEntityArrayWithEdits`' is particularly useful in ParameterProvider's '`mapOutgoingDataForCollector`' callback when returning an edited array to some ParameterCollector:

```typescript

this.parameterProvider = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.ParameterProvider<DataModels.ServerConfig[], KnockoutObservableArray<DataModels.ServerConfig>>(container, {
    editScopeMetadataType: DataModels.ServerConfigType,
    mapIncomingDataForEditScope: (incoming) => {
        return ko.observableArray(incoming);  // Editable grid can only bind to an observable array.
    },
    mapOutgoingDataForCollector: (outgoing) => {
        const editScope = this.parameterProvider.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'getEntityArrayWithEdits' to return an array with all created/updated/deleted items.
        return editScope.getEntityArrayWithEdits<DataModels.ServerConfig>(outgoing).arrayWithEdits;
    }
});

```

<a name="apply-array-as-edits"></a>
And there is a corresponding '`applyArrayAsEdits`' EditScope method that simplifies applying edits to an existing EditScope 'entity' array. This is often done in a ParameterCollector's '`receiveResult`' callback:

```typescript

this.itemsCollector = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.ParameterCollector<DataModels.ServerConfig[]>(container, {
    selectable: this.itemsSelector.selectable,
    supplyInitialData: () => {
        const editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'getEntityArrayWithEdits' to develop an array with all created/updated/deleted items
        // in this entity array.
        return editScope.getEntityArrayWithEdits<DataModels.ServerConfig>(editScope.root.serverConfigs).arrayWithEdits;
    },
    receiveResult: (result: DataModels.ServerConfig[]) => {
        const editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'applyArrayWithEdits' to examine the array returned from the Provider Blade
        // and apply any differences to our EditScope entity array in terms of created/updated/deleted entities.
        editScope.applyArrayAsEdits(result, editScope.root.serverConfigs);
    }
});

```

This pair of EditScope methods significantly simplifies working with EditScope 'entity' arrays.

### Q: Some of my Form data is not editable. How do I keep EditScope from tracking changes for this data?

See [mention of '`trackEdits`'](#track-edits) above re: configuring an EditScope via type metadata.  
  
  
<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-my-form-data-is-just-key-value-pairs-how-do-i-model-a-dictionary-stringmap-in-editscope-why-can-t-i-just-use-a-javascript-object-like-a-property-bag"></a>
### Q: My Form data is just key/value-pairs. How do I model a Dictionary/StringMap in EditScope? Why can&#39;t I just use a JavaScript object like a property bag?

<a name="only-observable-changes"></a>
Like all models and view models treated by the Azure Portal FX, once the object/array is instantiated and returned to the FX in the course of rendering UI, any subsequent mutation of that object/array should be done by changing/mutating Knockout observables. Azure Portal controls and Knockout HTML template-rendering both subscribe to these observables and re-render only when these observables change value.  

This poses a challenge to the common JavaScript programming technique of treating a JavaScript object as a property bag of key/value-pairs. If an extension merely adds/removes keys from a model or view model object, the FX will not be aware of these changes. Importantly, EditScope will not recognize these changes as user edits and - in fact - such key adds/removes will put EditScope edit-tracking in an inconsistent state.  

So, how does an extension model a Dictionary/StringMap/property bag when using the Azure Portal FX (and EditScope specifically)?  

The pattern to follow here, simply, is to develop the Dictionary/StringMap/property bag as an observable array of key/value-pairs, like `KnockoutObservableArray<{ key: string; value: TValue; }>`.  

Often, additionally, it is important to let users edit the Dictionary/StringMap/property bag using *an editable grid*. In such cases, it is important to describe the array of key/value-pairs as an 'entity' array since editable grid can only be bound to an EditScope 'entity' array. See [above](#editable-grid) re: how to develop type metadata to use the array with editable grid.  

Here's a sample that does something similar, converting - in this case - an array of strings into an 'entity' array for consumption by editable grid.

        // Editable grid only accepts an array of editable entities (that is, objects and not strings).
        const wrappedStrings = incoming.map((str) => {
            return {
                value: ko.observable(str)
            };
        });
        return ko.observableArray(wrappedStrings);  // Editable grid can only bind to an observable array.
    },

        // Use EditScope's 'getEntityArrayWithEdits' to return an array with all created/updated/deleted items.
        const entityArrayWithEdits = editScope.getEntityArrayWithEdits<StringWrapperType>(outgoing);

        // Unwrap each string to produce the expected string array.
        return entityArrayWithEdits.arrayWithEdits.map((wrapper) => {

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-what-do-i-return-from-saveeditscopechanges-i-don-t-understand-the-different-values-of-the-accepteditscopechangesaction-enum"></a>
### Q: What do I return from &#39;saveEditScopeChanges&#39;? I don&#39;t understand the different values of the &#39;<code>AcceptEditScopeChangesAction</code>&#39; enum.

When creating an EditScopeCache, the '`saveEditScopeChanges`' callback supplied by the extension is called to push EditScope edits to a server/backend. This callback returns a Promise that should be resolved when the 'save' AJAX call completes (once the server/backend accepts the user's edits).  

When the extension resolves this Promise, it can supply a value that instructs the EditScope how reset itself *to a clean/unedited state*. If no such value is returned during Promise resolution, then - by default - the EditScope is reset by taking the user's client-side edits and considering these values to be the new, clean/unedited EditScope state. This works for many scenarios.  

That said, there are scenarios where the default '`saveEditScopeChanges`' behavior *doesn't* work, like:  
* During 'save', the server/backend produces *new data values* that need to be merged into the EditScope.
* For "create new record" scenarios, after 'save', the user is to have their form cleared, so they can enter a new record.

For these cases, the extension will resolve their '`saveEditScopeChanges`' Promise with a value from the '`AcceptEditScopeChangesAction`' enum. Values of this enum allow the extension to specify - for instance - that:
* The EditScopeCache is to implicitly reload the EditScope data as part of completing the 'save' operation.
* The EditScope's data is to be reverted/cleared as part of completing the 'save' operation (the "create new record" UX scenario).
* ...etc.  

See the jsdoc comments around '`MsPortalFx.Data.AcceptEditScopeChangesAction`' for comprehensive documentation for each enum value.  

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-what-do-i-return-from-saveeditscopechanges-i-don-t-understand-the-different-values-of-the-accepteditscopechangesaction-enum-caveat-anti-pattern"></a>
#### Caveat / anti-pattern

There is an important anti-pattern to avoid here re: '`saveEditScopeChanges`'. If the AJAX call that saves the user's edits fails, the extension should merely **reject** the '`saveEditScopeChanges`' Promise (which is natural to do with Q Promise-chaining/piping). The extension *should not* resolve their Promise with '`AcceptEditScopeChangesAction.DiscardClientChanges`', since this will lose the user's Form edits (a data-loss bug).
  
  
<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-common-error-entity-typed-object-array-is-not-known-to-this-edit-scope"></a>
### Common error: &quot;Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope...&quot;

EditScope data follows a particular data model. In short, the EditScope is a hierarchy of 'entity' objects. By default, when the EditScope's '`root`' is an object, this object is considered an 'entity'. The EditScope becomes a hierarchy of 'entities' when:
* the EditScope includes an array of 'entity' objects
* some EditScope object includes a property that is 'entity'-typed  

An object is treated by EditScope as an 'entity' when type metadata associated with the object is marked as an 'entity' type (see [here](#entity-type) and the EditScope video/PPT [here](portalfx-forms-working-with-edit-scopes.md) for more details).

Every 'entity' object is tracked by the EditScope as being created/updated/deleted. Extension developers define 'entities' at a granularity that suit their scenario, making it easy to determine what in their larger EditScope/Form data model has been user-edited.  

Now, regarding the error above, once the EditScope is initialized/loaded, 'entities' can be introduced and removed from the EditScope only via EditScope APIs. It is an unfortunate design limitation of EditScope that extensions cannot simply make an observable change to add a new 'entity' object or remove an existing 'entity' from the EditScope. If an extension tries to do an observable add (make an observable change that introduces an 'entity' object into the EditScope), they'll encounter the error discussed here.  

To correctly (according to the EditScope design) add or remove an 'entity' object into/out of an EditScope, here are APIs that are useful:
* ['`applyArrayAsEdits`'](#apply-array-as-edits) - This API accepts a new array of 'entity' objects. The EditScope proceeds to diff this new array against the existing EditScope array items, determine which 'entity' objects are created/updated/deleted, and then records the corresponding user edits.
* '`getCreated/addCreated`' - These APIs allow for the addition of new, 'created' entity objects. The '`getCreated`' method returns a distinct, out-of-band array that collects all 'created' entities corresponding to a given 'entity' array. The '`addCreated`' method is merely a helper method that places a new 'entity' object in this '`getCreated`' array.
* '`markForDelete`' - 'Deleting' an 'entity' from the EditScope is treated as a non-destructive operation. This is so that - if the extension chooses - they can render 'deleted' (but unsaved) edits with strike-through styling (or equivalent). Calling this '`markForDelete`' method merely puts the associated 'entity' in a 'deleted' state.  

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-common-error-entity-typed-object-array-is-not-known-to-this-edit-scope-common-error-scenario"></a>
#### Common error scenario

Often, extensions encounter this "Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope..." error as a side-effect of modeling their data as 'entities' binding with [editable grid](#editable-grid) in some ParameterProvider Blade.  Then, commonly, the error is encountered when applying the array edits in a corresponding ParameterCollector Blade.  Here are two schemes that can be useful to avoid this error:
* Use the ['`applyArrayAsEdits'`](#apply-array-as-edits) EditScope method mentioned above to commit array edits to an EditScope.
* Define type metadata for this array *twice* - once only for editing the data in an editable grid (array items typed as 'entities'), and separately for committing to an EditScope in the ParameterCollector Blade (array items typed as not 'entities').  
  
  
<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-common-error-encountered-a-property-foo-on-an-editable-object-that-is-not-present-on-the-original-object"></a>
### Common error: &quot;Encountered a property &#39;foo&#39; on an editable object that is not present on the original object...&quot;

As discussed [above](#only-observable-changes), the extension should mutate the EditScope/Form model by making observable changes and by calling EditScope APIs. For any object residing in the EditScope, merely adding/removing keys cannot be detected by EditScope (or by the FX at large) and, consequently, edits cannot be tracked. When an extension *attempts* to add/remove keys from an EditScope object, this puts the EditScope edit-tracking in an inconsistent state. When the EditScope detects such an inconsistency, it issues the error above to encourage the extension developer to use (exclusively) observable changes and EditScope APIs to mutate/change the EditScope/Form model.
