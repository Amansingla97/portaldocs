## How to show mock ARM data in the Portal

Mockup data includes items like providers, subscriptions, resource groups and resources that can be defined in JSON objects and used to initialize the ArmManager. The **MsPortalFx-Mock**  package that is located at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/msportalfx-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msportalfx-mock) provides a framework for displaying mock data in the Portal. It come with builtin support for mocking ARM data. 

At the beginning of your tests, the extension should initialize the `ArmProxy` with the `ArmManager`. The `ArmProxy` supports two modes; it can show mock and actual data, or it can show mock data only, as in the following example.

```ts

import { ArmProxy } from "MsPortalFx-Mock/lib/src/ArmProxy/ArmProxy";
import { ArmManager } from "MsPortalFx-Mock/lib/src/ArmProxy/ArmManager";

...

const mockData: ArmManager.MockData = {
    providers: [
        {
            namespace: "Providers.Test",
            resourceTypes: [
                {
                    resourceType: "type1",
                    locations: ["WestUS"],
                    apiVersions: ["2014-04-01"]
                },
                {
                    resourceType: "type2",
                    locations: ["East US", "East US 2", "North Central US"],
                    apiVersions: ["2014-04-01"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    subscriptions: [
        {
            subscriptionId: "sub1",
            displayName: "Test sub 1",
            state: "Active",
            subscriptionPolicies: {
                locationPlacementId: "Public_2014-09-01",
                quotaId: "FreeTrial_2014-09-01"
            },
            resourceGroups: [
                {
                    name: "sub1rg1",
                    location: "WestUS",
                    tags: {
                        "env": "prod",
                        "ver": "4.6"
                    },
                    properties: {
                        lockState: "Unlocked",
                        provisioningState: "Succeeded",
                    },
                    resources: [
                        {
                            name: "sub1rg1r1",
                            location: "WestUS",
                            tags: {
                                "env": "prod"
                            },
                            type: "providers.test/type1",
                            kind: null,
                            nestedResources: [
                                {
                                    name: "nr1",
                                    tags: {},
                                    type: "nested"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    name: "sub1rg2",
                    location: "WestUS",
                    tags: {
                        "env": "prod",
                        "ver": "4.6"
                    },
                    properties: {
                        lockState: "Unlocked",
                        provisioningState: "Succeeded",
                    },
                    resources: [
                        {
                            name: "sub1rg2r1",
                            location: "WestUS",
                            tags: {
                                "env": "prod"
                            },
                            type: "providers.test/type2",
                            kind: null
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
};

...

    let armManager = new ArmManager.Manager();
    armManager.initializeMockData(mockData);
    
```

In the following sample, the test initializes the `portalContext->patches` to the local server address that was set up by the proxy.

```ts

        return ArmProxy.create(nconf.get("armEndpoint"), 5000, armManager, null, true).then(proxy => {
            armProxy = proxy;
            testFx.portal.portalContext.patches = [proxy.patchAddress];
        });
        
```

Remember to dispose of the proxy at the end of the test, as in the following example.
```ts

        return testFx.portal.quit().then(() => ArmProxy.dispose(armProxy));
        
```
