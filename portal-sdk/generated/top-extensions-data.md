## Overview

The Azure Portal UX provides unique data access challenges. Many blades and parts may be displayed at the same time, each of which instantiates a new `ViewModel` instance. Each `ViewModel` often needs access to the same or related data. To optimize for these interesting data-access patterns, extensions follow specific patterns that consist of code organization and data management.

The following sections discuss these patterns and how to apply them to an extension.

* **Code organization**

    * Organizing the extension source code into [areas](#areas)
    
* **Data management**

    * Shared data access using [data contexts](#data-contexts)

    * Using [data caches](#data-caches) to load and cache data

    * Memory management with [data views](#data-views)

All of these data concepts are used to achieve the goals of loading and updating extension data, in addition to efficient  memory  management. For more information about how the pieces fit together and how the resulting construct relates to the conventional MVVM pattern, see the [Data Architecture](https://auxdocs.blob.core.windows.net/media/DataArchitecture.pptx) video that discusses extension blades and parts.

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

### Areas

From the perspective of code organization, an area can be defined as a project-level folder. It is of great assistance when data operations are segmented within the extension. `Areas` are a scheme for organizing and partitioning the source code of the extension. This makes it easier for teams to develop an extension in parallel. Areas help categorize related blades and parts, and each area also maintains the data that is required by its blades and parts.

Every area within an extension gets a distinct `DataContext` singleton, and it loads/caches/updates the data that is associated with the models that support the area's blades and parts.

An area is defined in the extension by using the following steps.

  1. Create a folder in the `Client\` directory of the project that contains the extension. The name of that folder is the name of the area, in addition to being the name of the `DataContext`.

  1. In the root of that folder, create a file for the `DataContext` and name it `<AreaName>Area.ts`, where `<AreaName>` is the name of the folder that was just created, as specified in [#developing-a-datacontext-for-an-area](#developing-a-datacontext-for-an-area). For example, the `DataContext` for the `Security` area in the sample is located at `\Client\Security\SecurityArea.ts`.  

A typical extension resembles the following image.

<a name="working-with-data-overview-data-contexts"></a>
### Data contexts

For each area in an extension, there is a singleton `DataContext` instance that supports access to shared data for the blades and parts implemented in that area. Access to shared data means data loading, caching, refreshing and updating. Whenever multiple blades and parts make use of common server data, the `DataContext` is an ideal place to locate data logic for an extension [area](portalfx-extensions-glossary-data.md).

When a blade or part `ViewModel` is instantiated, its constructor is sent a reference to the `DataContext` singleton instance for the associated extension area.   The `ViewModel` accesses the data required by that blade or part in its constructor, as in the code located at `<dir>/Client/V1/MasterDetail/MasterDetailEdit/ViewModels/MasterViewModels.ts`.  The code is also in the following example.

```typescript

constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.ContainerContract, initialState: any, dataContext: MasterDetailArea.DataContext) {
    super();

    this.title(ClientResources.masterDetailEditMasterBladeTitle);
    this.subtitle(ClientResources.masterDetailEditMasterBladeSubtitle);

    this._view = dataContext.websitesQuery.createView(container);
    
```

The benefits of centralizing data access in a singleton `DataContext` include the following.

1. Caching and Sharing

   The `DataContext` singleton instance will exist for the entire amount of time that the extension is loaded in the browser. Consequently, when a blade is opened, and therefore a new blade `ViewModel` is instantiated, data required by the new blade may have previously been loaded and cached in the `DataContext`, because it was  required by some previously opened blade or rendered part.
  
   This cached data is available immediately, which optimizes rendering performance and improves [perceived responsiveness](portalfx-extensions-glossary-data.md). Also, no new **AJAX** calls are necessary to load the data for the newly-opened blade, which reduces server load and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

1. Consistency
  
   It is very common for multiple blades and parts to render the same data in levels of different detail, or with different presentation. Also, there are situations where such blades or parts are displayed on the screen simultaneously, or separated in time only by a single user navigation. 

   In these cases, the user expects to see all the blades and parts that describe the exact same state of the data. Using a shared `DataContext`  effectively achieves this consistency by allowing all the blades to use the single copy of the data that it contains.
  
1. Fresh data

   Users expect to see information that always reflects the current state of their data in the cloud. Another benefit of loading and caching data in a single location is that the cached data is regularly updated to accurately reflect the state of server data.

   For more information on refreshing data, see [portalfx-data-refreshingdata.md](portalfx-data-refreshingdata.md).

<a name="working-with-data-overview-data-caches"></a>
### Data caches
 
  The `DataCache` classes are a full-featured and convenient way to load and cache data required by blade and part `ViewModels`. The `DataCache` class objects in the API are `QueryCache`, `EntityCache` and the `EditScopeCache`. 

* QueryCache

  Loads data of type `Array<T>` according to an extension-specified `TQuery` type. `QueryCache` is useful for  list-like views like Grid, List, Tree, or Chart. For more information about the `QueryCache`, see [portalfx-data-caching.md#querycache](portalfx-data-caching.md#querycache). 
    
* EntityCache

  The `EntityCache` caches a single item, typically from the `QueryCache` object, as specified in [portalfx-data-caching.md#entitycache](portalfx-data-caching.md#entitycache).

* EditScopeCache

  The `EditScopeCache` class is less commonly used. It loads and manages instances of `EditScope`, which is a change-tracked, editable model for use in Forms, as specified in [portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md](portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md).
  
 * `DataCache` class methods

  The `DataCache` objects use the CRUD methods: Create, Replace, Update, and Delete. Commands for blades and parts often use these methods to modify server data. These commands are implemented in methods on the `DataContext` class, where each method can issue **AJAX** calls to the server and reflect data changes in associated DataCaches. For more information about sharnig  data across the parent and child blades, see  [portalfx-data-masterdetailsbrowse.md](portalfx-data-masterdetailsbrowse.md).

<a name="working-with-data-overview-data-views"></a>
### Data views

`DataCaches` in the `DataContext` of an `area` will exist in memory for as long as an extension is loaded, and consequently may support blades and parts that come and go as the user navigates in the Azure Portal.  Memory management becomes important, because memory overuse by many extensions or blades simultaneously can impact responsiveness. Consequently, each `DataCache` instance manages a set of [cache entries](portalfx-extensions-glossary-data.md), and the `DataCache` class includes  mechanisms to automatically manage the number of cache entries present at any given time. 

The data in the `DataCache`, and therefore the `DataContext`, is impacted by the needs of the `DataView` for the `ViewModel`. When a `ViewModel` calls the `fetch()` method for its `DataView`, the method implicitly forms a ref-count to a `DataCache` entry. This ref-count keeps the entry in the `DataCache` as long as the blade or part `ViewModel` has not been disposed by the extension.

The `DataCache` manages its size automatically, without explicit code in the extension source, by using the `DataView` to track the ref-counts to cache entries. When every blade or part `ViewModel` that holds a ref-count to a specific cache entry is disposed indirectly by using `DataView`, the `DataCache` can elect to discard the cache entry. 

<a name="working-with-data-overview-developing-a-datacontext-for-an-area"></a>
### Developing a DataContext for an area

The `DataContext` class does not specify the use of any single FX base class or interface. In practice, the members of a `DataContext` class typically include [data caches](#data-caches) and [data views](#data-views).

Typically, the `DataContext` associated with a particular area is instantiated from the `initialize()` method of `<dir>\Client\Program.ts`, which is the entry point of the extension, as in the following example.

```typescript

this.viewModelFactories.V1$MasterDetail().setDataContextFactory<typeof MasterDetailV1>(
    "./V1/MasterDetail/MasterDetailArea",
    (contextModule) => new contextModule.DataContext());

```

There is a single `DataContext` class per area. That class is named `<AreaName>Area.ts`, as in the code located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailArea.ts` and in the following example.

```typescript

/**
* Context for data samples.
*/
export class DataContext {
   /**
    * This QueryCache will hold all the website data we get from the website controller.
    */
   public websitesQuery: QueryCache<WebsiteModel, WebsiteQueryParams>;

   /**
    * Provides a cache that will enable retrieving a single website.
    */
   public websiteEntities: EntityCache<WebsiteModel, number>;

   /**
    * Provides a cache for persisting edits against a website.
    */
   public editScopeCache: EditScopeCache<WebsiteModel, number>;

```

   ## Best Practices 

<a name="advanced-data-topics-use-querycache-and-entitycache"></a>
### Use QueryCache and EntityCache

When performing data access from your view models, it may be tempting to make data calls directly from the `onInputsSet` function. By using the `QueryCache` and `EntityCache` objects from the `DataCache` class, you can control access to data through a single component. A single ref-counted cache can hold data across your entire extension.  This has the following benefits.

* Reduced memory consumption
* Lazy loading of data
* Less calls out to the network
* Consistent UX for views over the same data.

**NOTE**: Developers should use the `DataCache` objects `QueryCache` and `EntityCache` for data access. These classes provide advanced caching and ref-counting. Internally, these make use of Data.Loader and Data.DataSet (which will be made FX-internal in the future).

To learn more, visit [portalfx-data-caching.md#configuring-the-data-cache](portalfx-data-caching.md#configuring-the-data-cache).



<a name="advanced-data-topics-avoid-unnecessary-data-reloading"></a>
### Avoid unnecessary data reloading

As users navigate through the Ibiza UX, they will frequently revisit often-used resources within a short period of time.
They might visit their favorite Website Blade, browse to see their Subscription details, and then return to configure/monitor their
favorite Website. In such scenarios, ideally, the user would not have to wait through loading indicators while Website data reloads.

To optimize for this scenario, use the `extendEntryLifetimes` option that is available on the `QueryCache` object and the `EntityCache` object.

```ts

public websitesQuery = new MsPortalFx.Data.QueryCache<SamplesExtension.DataModels.WebsiteModel, any>({
    entityTypeName: SamplesExtension.DataModels.WebsiteModelType,
    sourceUri: MsPortalFx.Data.uriFormatter(Shared.websitesControllerUri),
    supplyData: (method, uri, headers, data) => {
        // ...
    },
    extendEntryLifetimes: true
});

```

The cache objects contain numerous cache entries, each of which are ref-counted based on not-disposed instances of QueryView/EntityView. When a user closes a blade, typically a cache entry in the corresponding cache object will be removed, because all QueryView/EntityView instances will have been disposed. In the scenario where the user revisits the Website blade, the corresponding cache entry will have to be reloaded via an **AJAX** call, and the user will be subjected to loading indicators on
the blade and its parts.

With `extendEntryLifetimes`, unreferenced cache entries will be retained for some amount of time, so when a corresponding blade is reopened, data for the blade and its parts will already be loaded and cached.  Here, calls to `this._view.fetch()` from a blade or part `ViewModel` will return a resolved Promise, and the user will not see long-running loading indicators.

**NOTE**:  The time that unreferenced cache entries are retained in QueryCache/EntityCache is controlled centrally by the FX
 and the timeout will be tuned based on telemetry to maximize cache efficiency across extensions.)

For your scenario to make use of `extendEntryLifetimes`, it is **very important** that you take steps to keep your client-side
QueryCache/EntityCache data caches **consistent with server data**.
See [Reflecting server data changes on the client](portalfx-data-configuringdatacache.md) for details.
