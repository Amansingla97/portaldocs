### Settings

One goal of the Azure Portal is to standardize key interaction patterns across resources, so that customers can learn them once and apply them everywhere. There a few setting items which are consistent across most resources. To make that process easier, the Framework will automatically add specific settings, but also allow extensions to opt in for any settings that the Framework does not automatically add. All the settings that are added by the Framework can always be opted out, by setting  the appropriate enabling option to `false`. 

Only two settings are added automatically: RBAC and Audit logs, or events. They are only added if a valid resource id was specified within the `resourceId()` property on the settingsList viewmodel. The best way to set this property is to use the `onInputsSet` call, as in the following code.

```ts
export class SettingListPartViewModel extends MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Parts.SettingList.ViewModelV2 {
    ...

     public onInputsSet(inputs: any): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
        var id = inputs.id;
        this.resourceId(id);

        return null
    }
}
```

#### Tags and RBAC

Tags and role-based access (RBAC) for users are the most common settings 
Although the Portal does not automatically add Tags, it is extremely easy to opt in if your resource supports tagging. To opt in set the following in the options parameter of the super call to the SettingsList viewmodel.

For more information about tags, see [./portalfx-tags](./portalfx-tags) and [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags).

```ts
export class SettingListPartViewModel extends MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Parts.SettingList.ViewModelV2 {
    constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainerContract, initialState: any, dataContext: BladesArea.DataContext) {
         super(container, initialState, this._getSettings(container),
            {
             enableRbac: true,
             enableTags: true,
             groupable: true
            });
    }
}
```

#### Support settings

Troubleshooting and support are one of these key experiences. We'd like to provide customers with a consistent gesture so for every resource they can assess its health, check the audit logs, get troubleshooting information, or open a support ticket. Every resource should on-board with Support and opt in to the support settings, see the [on-boarding process] [supportOnboarding]. For any questions regarding the process please reach out to the support adoption alias <AzSFAdoption@microsoft.com>

Enabling the support settings takes slightly more effort due to coordination and validation required with the support extension. For each of the settings you first need to opt in following the same pattern as before through the options parameter within the super call to the SettingsList ViewModel.

```ts
export class SettingListPartViewModel extends MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Parts.SettingList.ViewModelV2 {
    constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainerContract, initialState: any, dataContext: BladesArea.DataContext) {
         super(container, initialState, this._getSettings(container),
            {
             enableSupportHelpRequest: true,
             enableSupportTroubleshoot: true,
             enableSupportResourceHealth: true,
             enableSupportEventLogs: true,
             groupable: true
            });
    }
}
```

Then to test it use the following extension side feature flags, depending on which settings you are testing, **please ensure your extension name is in lower case.**

* ?<extensionName>_troubleshootsettingsenabled=true
* ?<extensionName>_healthsettingsenabled=true
* ?<extensionName>_requestsettingsenabled=true

*Example: ?microsoft_azure_classic_compute_requestsettingsenabled=true*
