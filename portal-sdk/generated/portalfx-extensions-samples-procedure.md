## Procedures for Portal Sample Source Code

After installing Visual Studio and the Portal Framework SDK, locate the samples in the `...\Documents\PortalSDK\FrameworkPortal\Extensions\SamplesExtension` folder.

Open the `SamplesExtension` solution file to experiment with samples in the IDE.

You can make changes to the samples as appropriate.

Click the F5 key to start debugging the sample extensions. This rebuilds the project, which will allow you to check for items like the most recent version of the SDK.

Sideload the extension. When it loads, click on the `More Services` option in the menu, as in the following example.

In the filter box, search for "Azure Portal SDK". You can use `Shift + Space` to mark it as a favorite site.

Make changes to the sample that best fits the needs of the development project, then refresh the Portal to view the changes.
