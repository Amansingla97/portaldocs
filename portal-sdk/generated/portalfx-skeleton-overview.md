<!-- topic name is a level 2 at the beginning of the doc>

<!--  required document.  -->

This document describes the topic at a general level.  If portions of the topic lend itself to further discussion, a subtopic document is a good idea. If so, the subtopics are not included in this document; instead, they are included in the overarching document that contains a gitHub link to this overview.  This method reduces gitHub commands to one document per topic.

Subtopic documents can authored along the same lines.
