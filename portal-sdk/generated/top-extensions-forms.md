# Developing Forms

The Azure SDK includes extensive support for displaying and managing user input. Forms are created using HTML templates, view models, and edit scopes. Developers can use standard HTML and **Knockout** to build their forms, in addition to the following items for which  the SDK framework includes support.

  * Labels
  * Validation, as in the following image

    ![alt-text](../media/portalfx-forms/forms.png "Forms Example") 
  * Change tracking
  * Form reset
  * Persisting edits across journeys and browser sessions
 
To develop extensions that use forms, review the following topics:

* [Designing and arranging the Form](portalfx-forms-sections.md)
* [Loading, editing and saving data](portalfx-forms-construction.md)
* [Form Field Validation](portalfx-forms-field-validation.md)
* [Working with Edit Scopes](portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md)
* [Integrating Forms with Commands](portalfx-forms-integrating-with-commands.md)

## Designing and Arranging the Form

<a name="developing-forms-designing-and-arranging-the-form-the-section-viewmodel"></a>
### The section viewModel

While blade templates allow manual layout of controls as specific DOM elements, the generally recommended approach is to bind a section `viewModel` into the DOM and then add control `viewModels` to the `children` observable array of the section. For example, the following image contains two sections with varying numbers of child objects in their respective arrays.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-forms-sections/forms-sections.png "Form Section")

The section `viewModel` provides default styling for spacing and margins and is an easy way to dynamically add and remove controls.

<a name="developing-forms-designing-and-arranging-the-form-the-customhtml-control"></a>
### The <code>CustomHtml</code> control

The `CustomHtml` control can be used to author HTML in an autogenerated layout. Many extensions use these
two controls to avoid large amounts of HTML in the blade template. However, placing the controls in the DOM manually is always an option if needed.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether "two controls" means the section viewModel and the customHtml control.
-->

To use a section, create a section ViewModel and bind it into the DOM in the blade template using the `pcControl` binding handler. Then add all the controls that should be displayed into the `children` observable array of the section. This positions the controls sequentially on a blade, by default. 

The section's `style` property can be used to achieve other layouts. This includes table layouts that display controls in multiple rows and columns, as a list of tabs, or as a combination of layouts.

## Forms Construction

<a name="developing-forms-forms-construction-loading-editing-and-saving-data"></a>
### Loading, editing and saving data

This sample reads and writes data to the server directly via `ajax()` calls. It loads and saves data by creating an `EditScopeCache` object and defining two functions. The `supplyExistingData` function reads the data from the server, and the `saveEditScopeChanges` function writes it back.

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment will display working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

The code for this example is associated with the basic form sample. It is located at 
* `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\FormsSampleBasic.pdl`
* `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\Templates\FormSampleBasic.html`
* `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FromsSampleBasicBlade.ts`

The code instantiates an `EditScope` via a `MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeView` object. When the data to manipulate is already located on the client, an edit scope view can also be obtained from other data cache objects.

<!--
```typescript

let editScopeCache = EditScopeCache.createNew<WebsiteModel, number>({
    supplyExistingData: (websiteId, lifetime) => {
        return FxBaseNet.ajax({
            uri: Util.appendSessionId(MsPortalFx.Base.Resources.getAppRelativeUri("/api/Websites/" + websiteId)), // this particular endpoint requires sessionId to be in query string
            type: "GET",
            dataType: "json",
            cache: false,
            contentType: "application/json"
        }).then((data: any) => {
            // after you get the data from the ajax query you can do whatever transforms
            // you want in it to turn it into the model type you've defined
            return {
                id: ko.observable(data.id),
                name: ko.observable(data.name),
                running: ko.observable(data.running)
            };
        });
    },
    saveEditScopeChanges: (websiteId, editScope, edits, lifetime, dataToUpdate) => {
        // get the website from the edit scope
        let website = editScope.root;

        // if you need to do conversion on the data before posting to server you can do that
        // all we need to do here is turn the knockout object into json
        let serializableWebsite = ko.toJSON(website);

        this._saving(true);
        return FxBaseNet.ajax({
            uri: Util.appendSessionId(MsPortalFx.Base.Resources.getAppRelativeUri("/api/Websites/" + websiteId)),
            type: "POST",
            dataType: "json",
            cache: false,
            contentType: "application/json",
            data: serializableWebsite
        }).then(() => {
            // Instruct the EditScope to accept the user-authored, client-side changes as the new state of the
            // EditScope after the 'saveChanges' has completed successfully.
            // ('AcceptClientChanges' is the default behavior.  This promise could also be resolved with 'null' or 'undefined'.)
            return {
                action: Data.AcceptEditScopeChangesAction.AcceptClientChanges
            }
        }).finally(() => {
            this._saving(false);
        });
    }
});

```
-->

Then, the code transforms the data to make it match the model type. The server returns strings, but the `WebsiteModel` type that is used is defined in the following code.

  ```ts
   interface WebsiteModel {
      id: KnockoutObservable<number>;
      name: KnockoutObservable<string>;
      running: KnockoutObservable<boolean>;
  }
  ```
  Therefore, the save and load functions have to transform the data to make it match the `WebsiteModel` model type. The control `viewModels` require a reference to a `Form.ViewModel`, so the code creates a form and sends the reference to the `editScope` to it, as in the following example.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FormsSampleBasicBlade.ts`
<!--
```typescript

this._form = new Form.ViewModel<WebsiteModel>(this._lifetime);
this._form.editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope;

```
-->

This form displays one textbox that allows the user to edit the name of the website, as specified in the following code.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FormsSampleBasicBlade.ts`
<!--
```typescript

let websiteName = new TextBox.ViewModel(
    this._lifetime,
    this._form,
    this._form.createEditScopeAccessor(data => data.name),
    {
        label: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameLabel),
        validations: ko.observableArray([
            new FxViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameRequired)
        ]),
        valueUpdateTrigger: ValueUpdateTrigger.Input // by default textboxes only update the value when the user moves focus. Since we don't do any expensive validation we can get updates on keypress
    });

// Section
this.section = new Section.ViewModel(this._lifetime, {
    children: ko.observableArray<any>([
        websiteName
    ])
});

```
-->

The form is rendered using a section. The code loads all the controls that should be displayed into the `children` observable array of the section. This positions the controls sequentially on a blade, by default, so it is an easy way to standardize the look of forms in the Portal. An alternative to the default positioning is to manually author the HTML for the form by binding each control into an HTML template for the blade.

This sample includes two commands at the top of the blade that will save or discard data. Commands are used because this blade stays open after a save/discard operation. If the blade were to close after the operation, then there would be an action bar at the bottom of the blade to use instead. 

The commands check to make sure that the `EditScope` has been populated previous to enabling themselves via the `canExecute` portion of the `ko.pureComputed` code.

The commands also keep themselves disabled during save operations via a `_saving` observable that the blade maintains, as in the following code.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Basic\ViewModels\FormsSampleBasicBlade.ts`

<!--
```typescript

// set up save command
let saveCommand = new Toolbars.CommandButton();
saveCommand.label(ClientResources.saveText);
saveCommand.icon(FxBase.Images.Save());
saveCommand.command = {
    canExecute: ko.pureComputed(() => {
        // user can save when edit scope is dirty and we're not in the middle of a save operation
        let editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();
        let editScopeDirty = !!editScope ? editScope.dirty() : false;
        return !this._saving() && editScopeDirty;
    }),
    execute: (context: any): FxBase.Promise => {
        return this._editScopeView.editScope().saveChanges();
    }
}

// set up discard command
let discardCommand = new Toolbars.CommandButton();
discardCommand.label(ClientResources.discardText);
discardCommand.icon(MsPortalFx.Base.Images.Delete());
discardCommand.command = {
    canExecute: ko.pureComputed(() => {
        // user can save when edit scope is dirty and we're not in the middle of a save operation
        let editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();
        let editScopeDirty = !!editScope ? editScope.dirty() : false;
        return !this._saving() && editScopeDirty;
    }),
    execute: (context: any): FxBase.Promise => {
        this._editScopeView.editScope().revertAll();
        return null;
    }
}

this.commandBar = new Toolbars.Toolbar(this._lifetime);
this.commandBar.setItems([saveCommand, discardCommand]);

```
-->

Because the `EditScope` is being used, the save/discard commands can just call the `saveChanges()` or `revertAll()` methods on the edit scope to trigger the right action.

<a name="developing-forms-form-field-validation"></a>
## Form Field Validation

Validating input is one of the primary benefits of the **Forms** API. Many simple and complex validators are available out of the box:

  * Required
  * Contains
  * Not Contains
  * Contains Characters
  * Not Contains Characters
  * Has Digit
  * Has Letter
  * Has Upper Case Letter
  * Has Lower Case Letter
  * Has Punctuation
  * Equals
  * Length Range
  * Min Length
  * Max Length
  * Numeric
  * Range
  * Min Value
  * Max Value
  * RegEx
  * Custom
  * Continuous Update

Validators also provide automatic error messages inside of a balloon control, as in the following image.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-forms-field-validation/formValidation.png "Form Validation")

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment will display working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

For an example of each of these validators in action, view the sample file that is located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\Validations\ViewModels\FormValidationsViewModels.ts`.

Validators are added to the form objects that are on the ViewModel, as in the following code.

```ts
var nameTextboxOptions  = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.Options>{
      label: ko.observable(ClientResources.required),
      validations: ko.observableArray([
          new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.pleaseEnterSomeText)
      ])
  };
  this.nameTextbox  = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox.ViewModel(
      this._container, this, "requiredFieldValue", nameTextboxOptions );
```


<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes"></a>
## Legacy Edit Scopes

**NOTE**:  EditScopes are becoming obsolete.   It is recommended that extensions be developed without edit scopes, as specified in [portalfx-editscopeless-forms.md](portalfx-editscopeless-forms.md).

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-working-with-edit-scopes"></a>
### Working with Edit Scopes

Edit scopes provide a standard way of managing edits over a collection of input fields, blades, and extensions. They provide many common functions that would otherwise be difficult to orchestrate, like the following:

  * Track changes in field values across a form
  * Track validation of all fields in a form
  * Provide a way to discard all changes in a form
  * Persist unsaved changes from the form to the cloud
  * Simplify merging changes from the server into the current edit

In some instances, development approaches that do not use `editScopes` are preferred.  For more information about forms without editScopes, see  [portalfx-editscopeless-forms.md](portalfx-editscopeless-forms.md) and [portalfx-controls-dropdown.md#migration-to the-new-dropdown.md](portalfx-controls-dropdown.md#migration-to the-new-dropdown.md).

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK. 

Any edits that were made by the user and collected in an `EditScope` are saved in the storage for the browser session. This is managed by the shell. Parts or blades may request an `EditScope`, but the most common usage is in a blade. A blade defines a `BladeParameter` with a `Type` of `NewEditScope`. This informs the shell that a blade is asking for a new `editScope` object. Within the rest of the blade, that parameter can be attached to an `editScopeId` property on any part. Using this method, many parts and commands on the blade can all read from the same editScopeId. This is common when a command needs to save information about a part. After sending the `editScopeId` to the part as a property, the `viewModel`  loads the `editScope` from the cloud. 

For more information about edit scopes and  managing unsaved edits, watch the video located at 
[https://aka.ms/portalfx/editscopes](https://aka.ms/portalfx/editscopes).

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-request-an-editscope-from-pdl"></a>
### Request an editscope from pdl

For an example of requesting an `editScope` from PDL, view the following code.  The sample is also located at `<dir>\Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailEdit\MasterDetailEdit.pdl`.  The `valid` is using the `section` object of the form to determine if the form is currently valid.  This is not directly related to the edit scope, but will be relevant in the section named []().


```xml
<!-- Display detail blade with an edit scope. Blade consists of a form and commands.-->
<Blade Name="DetailBlade"
       ViewModel="DetailBladeViewModel">
    <Blade.Parameters>
        <Parameter Name="currentItemId" Type="Key" />
        <Parameter Type="NewEditScope" />
        <Parameter Name="formValid" Type="Output" />
    </Blade.Parameters>

    <Lens Title="SamplesExtension.Resources.Strings.masterDetailEditDetailTitle">
        <CustomPart Name="DetailPart"
                    ViewModel="DetailPartViewModel"
                    Template="{Html Source=&#039;Templates\\WebsitesDetail.html&#039;}"
                    InitialSize="HeroWideFitHeight">
        <CustomPart.Properties>
            <!-- Generated by the shell. -->
            <Property Name="editScopeId"
                      Source="{BladeParameter editScopeId}" />
            <!-- Output parameter indicating whether the form is valid. -->
            <Property Name="valid"
                      Source="{BladeParameter formValid}"
                      Direction="Output" />
            <!-- Master passes an id of object that will be used to seed the edit scope. -->
            <Property Name="currentItemId"
                      Source="{BladeParameter currentItemId}" />
        </CustomPart.Properties>
      </CustomPart>
    </Lens>
</Blade>
```

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-load-an-edit-scope"></a>
### Load an edit scope

The data in the `editScope` includes original values and saved edits. The method to access inputs on a part is the `onInputsSet` method. In the constructor, a new `MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeView` object is created from the `dataContext`. The `EditScopeView` provides a stable observable reference to an `EditScope` object. The `editScopeId` will be sent in as a member of the `inputs` object when the part is bound.

For an example of loading an edit scope, view the following code.  The sample is also located at `<dir>\Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailEdit\ViewModels\DetailViewModels.ts`. 

<!-- TODO: Determine whether this inline code should be replaced when the samples code is replaced and linked in gitHub, or whether the links to the SDK samples are sufficient. -->
```ts
// create a new editScopeView
constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainerContract,
            initialState: any,
            dataContext: DataContext) {
    super();
    ...
    this._editScopeView = dataContext.masterDetailEditSample.editScopeCache.createView(container);
    // Initialize editScope of the base class.
    this.editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope;
    ...
}
```

```ts
// update the editScopeView with a new id
public onInputsSet(inputs: any): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
    // Acquires edit scope seeded with an item with id currentItemId.
    return this._editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(inputs.editScopeId, inputs.currentItemId);
}
```

<!--TODO:  Determine which piece of code is associated with this paragraph.  -->

 The code that loads the `EditScope` is largely related to data loading, so the data context is the preferred location for the code. 

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-load-an-edit-scope-from-a-data-context"></a>
### Load an edit scope from a data context

 <!--TODO:  The following sample code does not exist by this name.  -->
 For an example of loading an edit scope from a data context, view the sample that is located at `<dir>\Client\Data\MasterDetailEdit\MasterDetailEditData.ts`.
 <!--TODO:  The  previous sample code does not exist by this name.  -->

The following code creates a new `EditScopeCache`, which is bound to the `DataModels.WebsiteModel` object type. It uses an edit scope within a form.  The `fetchForExistingData()` method on the cache provides a promise, which informs the `ViewModel` that the `editScope` is loaded and available.

```ts
this.editScopeCache = MsPortalFx.Data.EditScopeCache.create<DataModels.WebsiteModel, number>({
    entityTypeName: DataModels.WebsiteModelType,
    supplyExistingData: (websiteId: number) => {
        var deferred = $.Deferred<JQueryDeferredV<DataModels.WebsiteModel>>();

        this.initializationPromise.then(() => {
            var website = this.getWebsite(websiteId);
            if (website) {
                deferred.resolve(website);
            } else {
                deferred.reject();
            }
        });
        return deferred;
    }
});
```

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-create-new-objects-and-bind-them-to-the-editscope"></a>
### Create new objects and bind them to the editScope

The following code creates a new set of form field objects and binds them to the `editScope`. The sample is also located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailBrowse\ViewModels\DetailViewModels.ts`.  

```ts
private _initializeForm(): void {

        // Form fields.
        var websiteNameFieldOptions = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBoxOptions>{
            label: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameLabel),
            validations: ko.observableArray([
                new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameRequired),
                new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RegExMatchValidation("^[a-zA-Z _]+$", ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameValidation)
            ]),
            emptyValueText: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditWebsiteNameInitial),
            labelPosition: ko.observable(MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.LabelPosition.Left)
        };

        this.websiteNameField = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.TextBox(this._container, this, "name", websiteNameFieldOptions);

        var isRunningFieldOptions = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.OptionsGroupOptions<boolean>>{
            label: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditRunningLabel),
            options: ko.observableArray([
                {
                    text: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditRunningOn),
                    value: true
                },
                {
                    text: ko.observable(ClientResources.masterDetailEditRunningOff),
                    value: false
                }
            ]),
            labelPosition: ko.observable(MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.LabelPosition.Left)
        };

        this.isRunningField = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.OptionsGroup(this._container, this, "running", isRunningFieldOptions);

        var generalSectionOptions = <MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.SectionOptions>{
            children: ko.observableArray([
                this.websiteNameField,
                this.isRunningField
            ]),
            style: ko.observable(MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.SectionStyle.Wrapper),
        };

        this.generalSection = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Forms.Section(this._container, generalSectionOptions);
    }
```

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-editscopeaccessor"></a>
### EditScopeAccessor

Form fields require a binding to one or more `EditScope` observables. Consequently, they have two constructor overloads.  Extension developers can configure this binding by supplying a path from the root of the EditScope/Form model down to the observable to which the form field should bind. They can do this by selecting one of the two form field constructor variations. 

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

1. **EditScopeAccessor** This is the preferred, compile-time verified methodology. The form field ViewModel constructor accepts an EditScopeAccessor, wraps a compile-time verified lambda, and returns the EditScope observable to which the Form field should bind, as in the following code.

    `<dir>/Client/V1/Forms/Scenarios/FormFields/ViewModels/FormFieldsFormIntegratedViewModels.ts`

    <!--gitdown": "include-section", "file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Forms/Scenarios/FormFields/ViewModels/FormFieldsFormIntegratedViewModels.ts", "section": "formsEditScopeFaq#editScopeAccessor"} -->
    The EditScopeAccessor methodology is preferred for the following reasons.

    * The supplied lambda will be compile-time verified. This code is more maintainable, for example, when the property names on the Form model types are changed.
    * There are advanced variations of `EditScopeAccessor` that enable less-common scenarios like binding multiple `EditScope` observables to a single form field or translating form model data for presentation to the user, as in the following code.

      `<dir>/Client/V1/Forms/Scenarios/FormFields/ViewModels/FormFieldsFormIntegratedViewModels.ts`

1. **String-typed path** This methodology is discouraged because it is not compile-time verified. The form field ViewModel constructor accepts a string-typed path that contains the location of the EditScope observable to which the Form field should bind, as in the following code.

### Editable entity arrays

***Q: The user added/removed rows from my editable grid, but I don't see the corresponding adds/removes in my EditScope array.  What gives?***

SOLUTION: EditScope 'entity' arrays were designed with a few requirements in mind:
* The user's edits need to be serialized so that Journey-switching works with unsaved Form edits. For editing large arrays, the FX should not serialize array edits by persisting two full copies of the potentially very large array.
* In the UI, the FX will want to render an indication of what array items were created/updated/deleted. In some cases, array removes need to be rendered with strike-through styling.
* Array adds/remove need to be revertable for some scenarios.

The resulting design made EditScope 'entity' arrays behave differently than regular JavaScript arrays.  Importantly:
* 'Creates' are kept out-of-band
* 'Deletes' are non-destructive

To conveniently see the *actual* state of an EditScope 'entity' array, use the '`getEntityArrayWithEdits`' EditScope method. This returns:
* An array that includes 'created' entities and doesn't include 'deleted' entities
* Discrete arrays that individually capture 'created', 'updated' and 'deleted' entities  

This '`getEntityArrayWithEdits`' is particularly useful in ParameterProvider's '`mapOutgoingDataForCollector`' callback when returning an edited array to some ParameterCollector, as in the following code.

```typescript

this.parameterProvider = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.ParameterProvider<DataModels.ServerConfig[], KnockoutObservableArray<DataModels.ServerConfig>>(container, {
    editScopeMetadataType: DataModels.ServerConfigType,
    mapIncomingDataForEditScope: (incoming) => {
        return ko.observableArray(incoming);  // Editable grid can only bind to an observable array.
    },
    mapOutgoingDataForCollector: (outgoing) => {
        const editScope = this.parameterProvider.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'getEntityArrayWithEdits' to return an array with all created/updated/deleted items.
        return editScope.getEntityArrayWithEdits<DataModels.ServerConfig>(outgoing).arrayWithEdits;
    }
});

```

<a name="developing-forms-legacy-edit-scopes-editable-entity-arrays-apply-array-as-edits"></a>
#### Apply array as edits

And there is a corresponding '`applyArrayAsEdits`' EditScope method that simplifies applying edits to an existing EditScope 'entity' array. This is often done in a ParameterCollector's '`receiveResult`' callback, as in the following example.

```typescript

this.itemsCollector = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.ParameterCollector<DataModels.ServerConfig[]>(container, {
    selectable: this.itemsSelector.selectable,
    supplyInitialData: () => {
        const editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'getEntityArrayWithEdits' to develop an array with all created/updated/deleted items
        // in this entity array.
        return editScope.getEntityArrayWithEdits<DataModels.ServerConfig>(editScope.root.serverConfigs).arrayWithEdits;
    },
    receiveResult: (result: DataModels.ServerConfig[]) => {
        const editScope = this._editScopeView.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'applyArrayWithEdits' to examine the array returned from the Provider Blade
        // and apply any differences to our EditScope entity array in terms of created/updated/deleted entities.
        editScope.applyArrayAsEdits(result, editScope.root.serverConfigs);
    }
});

```

This pair of EditScope methods significantly simplifies working with EditScope 'entity' arrays.

### Key-value pairs

<!-- TODO: Determine whether this section remains here, or should be moved to the edit grid document -->

***Q: My Form data is just key/value-pairs. How do I model a Dictionary/StringMap in EditScope? Why can't I just use a JavaScript object like a property bag?***

Like all models and view models treated by the Azure Portal FX, after the object/array is instantiated and returned to the FX in the process of rendering the UI, any subsequent mutation of that object/array should be done by changing/mutating **Knockout** observables. Portal controls and Knockout HTML template rendering both subscribe to these observables and re-render only when these observables change value.

This poses a challenge to the common JavaScript programming technique of treating a JavaScript object as a property bag of key-value-pairs. If an extension only adds or removes keys from a model or ViewModel object, the FX will not be aware of these changes. EditScope will not recognize these changes as user edits and therefore such key adds/removes will put EditScope edit-tracking in an inconsistent state.

So, how does an extension model a Dictionary/StringMap/property bag when using the Portal FX and EditScope?  

The pattern is to develop the Dictionary/StringMap/property bag as an observable array of key/value-pairs, like `KnockoutObservableArray<{ key: string; value: TValue; }>`. 

Often, additionally, it is important to let users edit the Dictionary/StringMap/property bag using *an editable grid*. In such cases, it is important to describe the array of key/value-pairs as an 'entity' array since editable grid can only be bound to an EditScope 'entity' array. For more information about how to develop type metadata to use the array with editable grid, see [#editable-grid](#editable-grid).

Here's a sample that does something similar, converting - in this case - an array of strings into an 'entity' array for consumption by editable grid.

<a name="developing-forms-integrating-forms-with-commands"></a>
## Integrating Forms with Commands

In most cases, editable forms are accompanied by commands which act upon those forms. There are two ways that form data can be made available to the command:

  * **Part property bindings**: a value from a part ViewModel on a blade may be bound into the command ViewModel
  * **Edit scope loading**: the editScopeId requested by the blade can be bound to a part and a command. By sharing an Id, they can act on the same object.

The most common use of part-to-command binding is sharing the `dirty` or `valid` properties of a form with a command ViewModel. The command ViewModel can enable or disable a save button based on validity, or enable or disable a discard button when edits are made. For example, when `EditScopeId` and `currentItemId` are acquired, the command can be enabled if the editscope is dirty and the form is valid, which implies that the form contains valid data.

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment will display working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

The sample  located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailEdit\ViewModels\DetailViewModels.ts` demonstrates a `SaveItemCommand` class that uses the binding between a part and a command. This code is also included in the following example.

<!--TODO:  Determine whether the code matches the sample that ships. This task should be performed for all code samples. --> 

```ts
this._editScopeView = dataContext.masterDetailEditSample.editScopeCache.createView(container);
this.enabled = ko.computed((): boolean => {
    // EditScopeId and currentItemId have to be already acquired, editscope dirty and the form valid to
    // command be enabled.
    return !this._editScopeView.loading() &&
        this._editScopeView.editScope() &&
        this._editScopeView.editScope().dirty() &&
        !this._editScopeView.editScope().saving() &&
        this._formValid();
});
```

In the previous snippet, the `enabled` property of the command is toggled based on the validity of the form. Inputs to this command include:

  * **editScopeId**: loaded by using a `NewEditScope` blade parameter
  * **currentItemId**: loaded by using a `Key` blade parameter
  * **formValid**: loaded by using the part that contains a form on the blade

## Frequently asked questions

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-should-i-use-an-action-bar-or-a-commands-toolbar-on-my-form"></a>
### Should I use an action bar or a commands toolbar on my form?

It depends on the scenario that drives the UX. If the form will capture some data from the user and expect the blade to be closed after submitting the changes, then use an action bar, as specified in [portalfx-ux-create-forms.md#action-bar-+-blue-buttons](portalfx-ux-create-forms.md#action-bar-+-blue-buttons).  However, if the form will edit or update some data, and expect the user to make multiple changes before the blade is closed, then use commands, as specified in [portalfx-commands.md](portalfx-commands.md). 

* Action Bar

  The action bar will have one button whose label is something like "OK", "Create", or "Submit". The blade should automatically close immediately after the action bar button is clicked. Users can abandon the form by clicking the Close button that is located at the top right of the application bar. Developers can use a `ParameterProvider` to simplify the code, because it provisions the `editScope` and implicitly closes the blade based on clicking on the action bar. 

  Alternatively, the action bar can contain two buttons, like "OK" and "Cancel", but that requires further configuration. The two-button method is not recommended because the "Cancel" button is made redundant by the Close button.

* Commands
  
  Typically, the two commands at the top of the blade are the "Save" command and the "Discard" command. The user can make edits and click "Save" to commit the changes. The blade should show the appropriate UX for saving the data, and will stay on the screen after the data has been saved. The user can make further changes and click "Save" again. The user can also discard their changes by clicking "Discard". Once the user is satisfied with the changes, they can close the blade manually.
  
* * * 

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-discard-change-pop-up-always-displayed"></a>
### Discard change pop-up always displayed

***Q: My users see the 'discard change?' pop-up, even when they've made no changes on my Form Blade. What's wrong?*** 

The EditScope `root` property returns an object or array that includes uses of Knockout observables (`KnockoutObservable<T>` and `KnockoutObservableArray<T>`). Any observable located within the EditScope is designed to be modified/updated only by the user, via Form fields that are bound to EditScope observables. Importantly, these EditScope observables were not designed to be modified directly from extension TypeScript code. If extension code modifies an observable during the Form/Blade initialization process, the EditScope will record this as a user edit, and this accidental edit will trigger the `discard changes` pop-up when the user tries to close the associated Blade.  

SOLUTION:
Rather than initializing the EditScope by programmatically modifying/updating EditScope observables, use these alternative techniques:
* If the extension uses a ParameterProvider component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the '`mapIncomingData[Async]`' callback supplied to ParameterProvider.
* If the extension uses an EditScopeCache component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the '`supplyNewData`' and '`supplyExistingData`' callbacks supplied to EditScopeCache.
* If neither of the above techniques suits the scenario, the '`editScope.resetValue()`' method can be used to set a new/initial value for an EditScope observable in a way that *is not recorded as a user edit* (although this only works for observables storing primitive-typed values).  
  
* * *

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-editscope-location"></a>
### EditScope Location

***Q: I need to integrate my Form with an EditScope. Where do I get the EditScope?*** 

SOLUTION: This varies according to the UX design. Developers can choose between using a `ParameterProvider` component or `EditScopeCache` component as follows:

* Use `ParameterProvider` for the following scenario:
    * **Pop-up/dialog-like form** - The blade uses an ActionBar with an 'Ok'-like button that commits user edits. Typically, when the user commits the edits, the blade is implicitly closed, like a conventional UI pop-up/dialog. The blade uses `parameterProvider.editScope` to access the loaded/initialized EditScope.

* Use `EditScopeCache` for the following scenarios:
    * **Save/Revert blade** - There are 'Save' and 'Revert changes' commands in the CommandBar of the blade. Typically, these commands keep the blade open so the user can perform successive edit and save cycles without closing and reopening the form. The blade uses an `EditScopeView`, as specified in  `editScopeCache.createView(...)`, to load/acquire the EditScope.  

    * **Document editing** - The blade uses an `EditScopeView`, as specified in  `editScopeCache.createView(...)`, to load/acquire the EditScope.   The user can make edits to a single EditScope/Form model across multiple parent-child blades. The parent blade sends its `inputs.editScopeId` input to any child blade that edits the same model as the parent Blade. The child blade uses this `inputs.editScopeId` in its call to `editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(editScopeId)` to fetch the EditScope of the parent Blade. Scenarios like these resemble document editing.

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-q-what-should-be-returned-from-saveeditscopechanges-i-don-t-understand-the-different-values-of-the-accepteditscopechangesaction-enum"></a>
### Q: What should be returned from &#39;saveEditScopeChanges&#39;? I don&#39;t understand the different values of the <code>AcceptEditScopeChangesAction</code> enum.

<!-- TODO:  Move this to the EditScope document -->

SOLUTION: 
When creating an EditScopeCache, the `saveEditScopeChanges` callback supplied by the extension is called to push EditScope edits to a server/backend. This callback returns a `Promise` that should be resolved when the 'save' AJAX call completes, which occurs after the server/backend accepts the user's edits. 

When the extension resolves this `Promise`, it can supply a value that instructs the EditScope to  reset itself to a clean/unedited state. If no such value is returned during Promise resolution, then the EditScope is reset by default.  This means taking the user's client-side edits and considering these values to be the new, clean/unedited EditScope state. This works for many scenarios.  

There are scenarios where the default `saveEditScopeChanges` behavior does not work, like: the following. 
* During 'save', the server/backend produces new data values that need to be merged into the EditScope.
* For "create new record" scenarios, after 'save', the extension should clear the form, so that the user can enter a new record.

For these cases, the extension will resolve the `saveEditScopeChanges` Promise with a value from the `AcceptEditScopeChangesAction` enum. These values allow the extension to specify conditions like the following.
* The EditScopeCache is to implicitly reload the EditScope data as part of completing the 'save' operation.
* The EditScope's data is to be reverted/cleared as part of completing the 'save' operation (the "create new record" UX scenario).

For more information about each enum value, see the jsdoc comments around `MsPortalFx.Data.AcceptEditScopeChangesAction` or in `MsPortalFxDocs.js` in Visual Studio or any code editor.

#### Caveat / anti-pattern

There is an important anti-pattern to avoid here re: '`saveEditScopeChanges`'. If the AJAX call that saves the user's edits fails, the extension should merely **reject** the '`saveEditScopeChanges`' Promise (which is natural to do with Q Promise-chaining/piping). The extension *should not* resolve their Promise with '`AcceptEditScopeChangesAction.DiscardClientChanges`', since this will lose the user's Form edits (a data-loss bug).

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-common-error-entity-typed-object-array-is-not-known-to-this-edit-scope"></a>
### Common error: &quot;Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope...&quot;

SOLUTION: 
EditScope data follows a particular data model. In short, the EditScope is a hierarchy of 'entity' objects. By default, when the EditScope's '`root`' is an object, this object is considered an 'entity'. The EditScope becomes a hierarchy of 'entities' when:
* the EditScope includes an array of 'entity' objects
* some EditScope object includes a property that is 'entity'-typed  

An object is treated by EditScope as an 'entity' when type metadata associated with the object is marked as an 'entity' type (see [here](#entity-type) and the EditScope video located at [here](portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md) for more details).

Every 'entity' object is tracked by the EditScope as being created/updated/deleted. Extension developers define 'entities' at a granularity that suit their scenario, making it easy to determine what in their larger EditScope/Form data model has been user-edited.  

Now, regarding the error above, once the EditScope is initialized/loaded, 'entities' can be introduced and removed from the EditScope only via EditScope APIs. It is an unfortunate design limitation of EditScope that extensions cannot simply make an observable change to add a new 'entity' object or remove an existing 'entity' from the EditScope. If an extension tries to do an observable add (make an observable change that introduces an 'entity' object into the EditScope), they'll encounter the error discussed here.  

To correctly (according to the EditScope design) add or remove an 'entity' object into/out of an EditScope, here are APIs that are useful:
* ['`applyArrayAsEdits`'](#apply-array-as-edits) - This API accepts a new array of 'entity' objects. The EditScope proceeds to diff this new array against the existing EditScope array items, determine which 'entity' objects are created/updated/deleted, and then records the corresponding user edits.
* '`getCreated/addCreated`' - These APIs allow for the addition of new, 'created' entity objects. The '`getCreated`' method returns a distinct, out-of-band array that collects all 'created' entities corresponding to a given 'entity' array. The '`addCreated`' method is merely a helper method that places a new 'entity' object in this '`getCreated`' array.
* '`markForDelete`' - 'Deleting' an 'entity' from the EditScope is treated as a non-destructive operation. This is so that - if the extension chooses - they can render 'deleted' (but unsaved) edits with strike-through styling (or equivalent). Calling this '`markForDelete`' method merely puts the associated 'entity' in a 'deleted' state.  

* * *

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-common-error-entity-typed-object-array-is-not-known-to-this-edit-scope-common-error-scenario"></a>
#### Common error scenario

SOLUTION: 
Often, extensions encounter this "Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope..." error as a side-effect of modeling their data as 'entities' binding with [editable grid](#editable-grid) in some ParameterProvider Blade.  Then, commonly, the error is encountered when applying the array edits in a corresponding ParameterCollector Blade.  Here are two schemes that can be useful to avoid this error:
* Use the [`applyArrayAsEdits'](#apply-array-as-edits) EditScope method mentioned above to commit array edits to an EditScope.
* Define type metadata for this array *twice* - once only for editing the data in an editable grid (array items typed as 'entities'), and separately for committing to an EditScope in the ParameterCollector Blade (array items typed as not 'entities').  
  
* * *

<a name="developing-forms-frequently-asked-questions-editable-object-not-present"></a>
### Editable object not present

***"Encountered a property 'foo' on an editable object that is not present on the original object..."***

SOLUTION: 
As discussed in [portalfx-extensions-faq-forms.md#key-value-pairs](portalfx-extensions-faq-forms.md#key-value-pairs), the extension should mutate the EditScope/Form model by making observable changes and by calling EditScope APIs. For any object residing in the `EditScope`, merely adding and removing keys cannot be detected by `EditScope` or by the FX at large and, consequently, edits cannot be tracked. When an extension attempts to add or remove keys from an `EditScope` object, this puts the `EditScope` edit-tracking in an inconsistent state. When the `EditScope` detects such an inconsistency, it issues the `Encountered a property...` error to encourage the extension developer to use only observable changes and `EditScope` APIs to mutate/change the EditScope/Form model.
