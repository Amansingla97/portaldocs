# Partner Request Process

The Partner Request process allows you to tell the Ibiza team your ideas for Framework improvements.  This ideas may help us assist you in achieving your goal of a richer customer experience in the Ibiza portal. You can help us identify needed enhancements or features for the framework.

The Uservoice forum, located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice), is a place where you can post ideas that may help us improve the Portal. We can select popular ideas that can be implemented after inclusion in our forecasting.

The following is a diagram of the process used to file a new request.

## How the Ibiza team prioritizes requests

The Ibiza team reviews [Uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice) ideas once per week. We assign a higher priority to requests that unblock a scenario that is required to complete a benchmark usability task. Requests that have the most votes will be considered for the next Ibiza quarterly planning cycle. We will consider implementing the items that have received the most votes as bandwidth permits. For more urgent requests, please contact <a href="mailto:ibizafxpm@microsoft.com">ibizafxpm@microsoft.com</a> to engage with PMs on our team.

The status of the item is initially marked "**blank**".  After we have prioritized an item and feel that it contains sufficient data to be acted upon, we will update the status, as in the following image.

If an item needs more data, or is declined, then we will email you during the prioritization process.  The status of the items will be marked  "**In Progress**" after we begin the implementation process.
