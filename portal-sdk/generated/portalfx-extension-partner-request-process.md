## How we will triage your request?

1.  We triage once per week.
1.	Highly voted requests will be considered for the next Ibiza quarterly planning cycle. 
1.	We will opportunistically pull the highest voted items into the current cycle as bandwidth permits.  
1.	For more urgent requests, again, you are free to engage with PMs on our team.
1.	We will give higher priority to requests that block a scenario that is required to get one of your benchmark usability tasks.  
1.	Items with status<>``"<blank>|under review"`` once we’ve read through the item and feel it has sufficient data for the item to be acted upon.
1.	If an item needs more data or is declined then we will email you during the triage.
1.	Items will be marked as Work Status = **In Progress** once we’ve started working on it.

Here is the flow diagram for tracking purpose.
