<a name="page-filtering"></a>
# Page Filtering
<!-- Fill in the name above and then write a short description of the design pattern.  For example
"Forms are the manner in which we gather and validate user input."
-->
Filtering enables users to quickly winnow down a list to the result set they are seeking.

<a name="context"></a>
# Context
<!-- Short description of the context.  For example, "Users input information when managing Azure resources." -->
Azure shows lists of resources and graphical representations of data that must allow the users to focus on a subset of information

<a name="problem"></a>
# Problem
<!-- Short description of the problem.  For example, 
"Users need to input information to create, deploy and configure resources."
-->
Users have a lot of resources in Azure and often need to focus on a subset.

<a name="solution"></a>
# Solution
<!-- Short description of the solution For example 
"The portal offers several input methods with consistent field and form validation to ensure users can easily input information and understand whether that info is valid.  " 
-->
The portal enbales users to add, remove and customize filters on pages so that users can see exactly what they want.
