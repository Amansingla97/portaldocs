## Best Practices
<!-- Title is required, as a level 2 heading.  If appropriate, the phrase ' for <topic>' can be appended. -->

Best practices often result in improved performance, smaller software footprint, increased reusability, or similar factors. Some practices are documented in industry practice, like the ***Testing Computer Software*** textbook that is located at [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220689439_Testing_computer_software_2_ed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220689439_Testing_computer_software_2_ed). Although Stackoverflow contains good ideas, it is a forum centered more around answering questions than providing best practices.

This document contains best practices, that are related to the topic whose name is a node in the filename. These practices did not fit in the overview discussion of the topic or subtopic, for whatever reasons. They also did not belong in a procedure document for the topic. If there are no best practices for a topic, this optional  document can be added when appropriate.

In the discussion, mention why these practices are considered best practices, or are good practice for the industry or within software development.  If some of these practices are results of usability studies, a sentence like the following is appropriate.

"This section also includes practices that are recommended based on customer feedback and usability studies."

Descriptions that are in other ***Best Practices*** documents should not be copied into this document.  Instead, summarize the procedure here and use a link to the content that is in the other document. These links are usually called out with the phrase "For more information, see . . . " and are the last sentence in the section.

### Best Practice Description

The title of the practice should be less than about five words long. The titles, which are level 3 headings in HTML, do not need to be numbered.

The description or procedure should be no more than about 5 paragraphs long, where a paragraph is no less than 4 sentences.

Each best practice section ends with three asterisks, as in '* * *' to include a dividing line between topics.
