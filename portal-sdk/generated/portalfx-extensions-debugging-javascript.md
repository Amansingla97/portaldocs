## Debugging JavaScript

In most cases, the code that is being debugged is part of the extension. To locate the source code files, press CTRL+P and search for the extension by name: ```<extensionName>ScriptsCore.js```, without the angle brackets, and open the file. All available source files can be searched using CTRL+SHIFT+F, as in the following image.

To debug a specific view model, search for the code by class name. You can now set breakpoints, add watch variables, and step through the code as described in  the video guide named ***How to step through your code***, located at [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/step-code](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/step-code).
