# CheckBox

 
<a name="basics"></a>
### Basics
A CheckBox is a UI element that allows users to switch between two mutually exclusive options (checked or unchecked, on or off) through a single click or tap. It can also be used to indicate a subordinate setting or preference when paired with another control.

### When to use
A CheckBox is used to select or deselect action items. It can be used for a single item or for a list of multiple items that a user can choose from. The control has two selection states: unselected and selected.

Use multiple CheckBoxes for multi-select scenarios in which a user chooses one or more items from a group of choices that are not mutually exclusive.  A DropDown may also be considered for multi-select.

Use a single CheckBox for a subordinate setting, such as with a "Remember me?" login scenario or with a terms of service agreement.

To select a **single option** among existing values.  Choose the control best suited to your needs
* **CheckBox** - a choice between 2 mutually exclusive options.  For example, use a single CheckBox for "I agree" instead of a different control where the user chooses between "I agree" and "I don't agree".
* **DropDown** - a single choice between a large number of options.  The DropDown control is also used on a smaller set of options where the default option is recommended for most users.  The DropDown control can also be used to make multiple selections from a set of options.
* **OptionsGroup** - a single choice between 2-7 equally weighted options where the options names are short.  For example, if the choices are On/Off, Yes/No, or None/Basic/Advanced an option group will work well.  For  On/Off, Yes/No you can also consider a CheckBox.
* **RadioButtons** - a single choice between 2-7 equally weighted options where the option names are long.   
* **TriStateCheckBox** - can be checked, not checked or partially checked to indicate the checked state of children items in a hierarchy.

### Best practices

<a name="best-practices-do"></a>
#### Do

* Allow users to choose any combination of options when several CheckBoxes are grouped together.

<a name="best-practices-don-t"></a>
#### Don&#39;t

* Don't use a CheckBox as an on/off control. Instead use a toggle switch.
* Don’t use a CheckBox when the user can choose only one option from the group, use radio buttons instead.
* Don't put two groups of CheckBoxes next to each other. Separate the two groups with labels.
