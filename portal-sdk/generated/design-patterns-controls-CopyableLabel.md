### When to use
Displaying and gathering text is available via multiple controls, choose the one most suited to your needs
* CopyableLabel - multi-line text input with built-in support for infoBalloonContent and an easy way for user to copy value.
* MultilineTextBox - multi-line text input with built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText
* NumericTextBox - restricts input to numbers only and built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText
* PasswordBox - text input that uses a * character instead of echoing user input with built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText.  Use PasswordBox for security sensitive fields.
* TextBlock - Readonly control used to display text.
* TextBox - single-line text input with built-in support for validations, infoBalloonContent and placeHolderText
