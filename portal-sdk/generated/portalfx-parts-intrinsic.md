## Intrinsic Parts

Intrinsic parts are composed of existing controls in the portal, and provide patterns for solving common patterns in the portal.

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

Many of the intrinsics can be found in the playground located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/playground](https://aka.ms/portalfx/playground).

The remainder of them can be located in the working copy located at  [https://aka.ms/portalfx/samples/#blade/SamplesExtension/IntrinsicPartsIndexBlade](https://aka.ms/portalfx/samples/#blade/SamplesExtension/IntrinsicPartsIndexBlade).
