## Overview

Developing a Portal extension, has three phases: private preview, public preview, and Global Availability (GA). Azure Portal onboarding is creating a UI for a service in Azure Portal, and is a subset of Azure onboarding.

Most services that onboard to Azure can leverage the following components of the Azure ecosystem:
1. Management APIs that are exposed via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) or Microsoft Graph
1. Management UI in the Azure Portal and/or other tools/websites, like Visual Studio
1. Marketing content on the Azure Web site or other websites

The Azure onboarding process is streamlined to optimize the delivery of high-quality experiences based on hundreds of hours of usability testing that meet Microsoft Common Engineering Criteria (CEC) and compliance requirements. This will better optimize developer resources and reduce re-working due to anti-patterns and inconsistencies that block usability, performance, and other factors. Therefore, we strongly recommend starting the onboarding process previous to designing UI or management APIs.
