### Discard change pop-up always displayed

***Q: My users see the 'discard change?' pop-up, even when they've made no changes on my Form Blade. What's wrong?*** 

The EditScope `root` property returns an object or array that includes uses of Knockout observables (`KnockoutObservable<T>` and `KnockoutObservableArray<T>`). Any observable located within the EditScope is designed to be modified/updated only by the user, via Form fields that are bound to EditScope observables. Importantly, these EditScope observables were not designed to be modified directly from extension TypeScript code. If extension code modifies an observable during the Form/Blade initialization process, the EditScope will record this as a user edit, and this accidental edit will trigger the `discard changes` pop-up when the user tries to close the associated Blade.

SOLUTION:
Rather than initializing the EditScope by programmatically modifying/updating EditScope observables, use these alternative techniques:
* If the extension uses a `ParameterProvider` component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the `mapIncomingData[Async]` callback supplied to ParameterProvider.
* If the extension uses an EditScopeCache component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the `supplyNewData` and `supplyExistingData` callbacks supplied to EditScopeCache.
* If neither of the above techniques suits the scenario, the `editScope.resetValue()` method can be used to set a new/initial value for an EditScope observable in a way that *is not recorded as a user edit* (although this only works for observables storing primitive-typed values).

### EditScope Location

***Q: I need to integrate my Form with an EditScope. Where do I get the EditScope?*** 

**NOTE**:  EditScopes are becoming obsolete.  It is recommended that extensions and forms be developed without edit scopes, as specified in [top-editscopeless-forms.md](top-editscopeless-forms.md).

SOLUTION: Integrate forms with `EditScopes` varies according to the UX design. Developers can choose between using a `ParameterProvider` component or `EditScopeCache` component as follows:

* Use `ParameterProvider` for the following scenario:
    * **Pop-up/dialog-like form** - The blade uses an ActionBar with an 'Ok'-like button that commits user edits. Typically, when the user commits the edits, the blade is implicitly closed, like a conventional UI pop-up/dialog. The blade uses `parameterProvider.editScope` to access the loaded/initialized EditScope.

* Use `EditScopeCache` for the following scenarios:
    * **Save/Revert blade** - There are 'Save' and 'Revert changes' commands in the CommandBar of the blade. Typically, these commands keep the blade open so the user can perform successive edit and save cycles without closing and reopening the form. 

    * **Document editing** - In the document-editing scenario, the user can make edits to a single EditScope/Form model across multiple parent-child blades. The parent blade sends its `inputs.editScopeId` input to any child blade that edits the same model as the parent Blade. The child blade uses this `inputs.editScopeId` in its call to `editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(editScopeId)` to fetch the EditScope of the parent Blade.

### What is an EditScopeAccessor?

***Q: Form fields have two constructor overloads, which should I use? What is an EditScopeAccessor?*** 

SOLUTION: For more information about EditScopeAccessors, see [top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-editscopeaccessor](top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-editscopeaccessor).

### Type metadata
<!-- TODO:  Move this back to the TypeScript  document -->
***Q: When do I need to worry about type metadata for my EditScope?***

SOLUTION: For many of the most common Form scenarios, there is no need to describe the EditScope/Form model in terms of type metadata. Typically, supplying type metadata is the way to turn on advanced FX behavior, in the same way that .NET developers apply custom attributes to .NET types to tailor .NET FX behavior for each customized types. 

For more information about type metadata, see [portalfx-data-typemetadata.md](portalfx-data-typemetadata.md).

 For EditScope and Forms, extensions supply type metadata for the following scenarios.

 * Editable grid
 
    Specified in [top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays](top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays).

 * Opting out of edit tracking 

    Specified in [top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-trackedits-property](top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-trackedits-property).

### Keeping EditScope from tracking changes

***Q: Some of my Form data is not editable. How do I keep EditScope from tracking changes for this data?***

SOLUTION: For more information about configuring an EditScope by using type metadata, see [top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-trackedits-property](top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-trackedits-property).

### Key-value pairs

***Q: My Form data is just key/value pairs. How do I model a Dictionary/StringMap in EditScope? Why can't I just use a JavaScript object like a property bag?***

DESCRIPTION:  The  Azure Portal FX instantiates an object/array and returns it to the extension to render the UI. Like all data models and `ViewMmodels`, any subsequent mutation of that object/array should be performed by changing/mutating **Knockout** observables. Portal controls and **Knockout** **HTML** template rendering both subscribe to these observables and re-render them only when these observables change value.

This poses a challenge to the common `JavaScript` programming technique of treating a `JavaScript` object as a property bag of key-value pairs. If an extension only adds or removes keys from a datamodel or a `ViewModel` object, the Portal will not be aware of these changes. `EditScope` will not recognize these changes as user edits and therefore such adds/removes will put `EditScope` edit-tracking in an inconsistent state.

SOLUTION:  An extension can model a Dictionary/StringMap/property bag for an `EditScope` by instantiating an  observable array of key/value-pairs, like `KnockoutObservableArray<{ key: string; value: TValue; }>`. 

The users can edit the contents of the  Dictionary/StringMap/property bag by using an editable grid. The editable grid can only be bound to an `EditScope` 'entity' array. This allows the extension to describe the array of key/value-pairs as an 'entity' array.

For more information about how to develop type metadata to use the array with the editable grid, see [top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-getEntityArrayWithEdits-method](top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-getEntityArrayWithEdits-method).
