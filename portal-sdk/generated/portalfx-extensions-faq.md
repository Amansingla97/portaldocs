### SSL Certs
   
***How do I use SSL certs?***
 
 SSL Certs are relevant only for teams that host their own extensions.  Azure Portal ONLY supports loading extensions from HTTPS URLs. Use a wildcard SSL cert for each environment to simplify maintenance, for example,   ``` *.<extensionName>.onecloud-ext.azure-test.net  ``` or  ``` *.<extensionName>.ext.azure.com) ``` .    To simplify overall management when your team is building separate, independent extensions, you can also use  ``` <extensionName>.<team>.ext.azure.com ``` and create a wildcard SSL cert for  ``` *.<team>.ext.azure.com ```. Internal teams can create SSL certs for the DogFood environment using the SSL Administration Web page that is located at [http://ssladmin](http://ssladmin). 
 
  Production certs must follow your organizationâ€™s PROD cert process. 

 **NOTE** Do not use the SSL Admin site for production certs.

### Sideloading Extension gets an ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE

*** My Extension fails to side load and I get an ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE in the browser console ***

![ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE](../media/portalfx-testinprod/errinsecureresponse.png)

In this case the browser is trying to load the extension but the SSL certificate from localhost is not trusted the solution is to install/trust the certificate.

#### Sideloading friendly names

***Sideloading friendly names is not working in the Dogfood environment***

In order for Portal to load  a test version of an extension, i.e., load without using the PROD stamp, developers can append the feature flag `feature.canmodifystamps`. The following example uses the sideload url to load the "test" version of extension.

`https://portal.azure.com?feature.canmodifystamps=true&<extensionName>=test`

The parameter `feature.canmodifystamps=true` is required for side-loading, and 
 **extensionName**, without the angle brackets, is replaced with the unique name of extension as defined in the `extension.pdl` file.
