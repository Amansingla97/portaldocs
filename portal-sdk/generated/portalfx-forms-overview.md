# Developing Forms

The Azure SDK includes extensive support for displaying and managing user input. Forms are created using HTML templates, view models, and edit scopes. Developers can use standard HTML and **Knockout** to build their forms, in addition to the following items for which  the SDK framework includes support.

  * Labels
  * Validation, as in the following image
