### When to use
There are a set of date, time and duration pickers available in the SDK.  Choose the one that is most suitable to your need.
* **DatePicker** - gets a specific date including month, day and year
* **DateTimePicker** - gets a specific date including month, day, year and time including hours, minutes, seconds
* **DateTimeRangePicker** - gets a range of time between two date and times
* **DayPicker** - gets a day of the month
* **DurationPicker** - gets a duration in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds
* **TimePicker** - gets a time including hours, minutes, seconds

### Best practices
Use the DayPicker when the user must select a day.

<a name="best-practices-do"></a>
#### Do

* Use the control as a single entity.
* Set the default date to the current date unless a specific date is required for context (e.g. the date of the conference).
* The control is designed to resize relative to available screen width. Allow it to render in either wide or narrow as appropriate.
* The control renders date in a specific format. If allowing for manual entry of date, provide helper text in the appropriate format.

<a name="best-practices-don-t"></a>
#### Don&#39;t

* Don't attempt to break apart year from month/day selectors. If granularity is required, use the Dropdown control or something similar.
* Don't attempt to force resize the control in any way.
* Don't force the control to render one mode vs. the other (year or month/day)
