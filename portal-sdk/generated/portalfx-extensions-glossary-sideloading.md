| endpoint                     | A device that is connected to a LAN and accepts or transmits communications across a network. In terms of directories or Web pages, there may be several endpoints that are defined on the same device.  |
| extension stamp              | An instance of a service in a region. Every extension can deploy one or more extension editions based on testing requirements. The main extension is used for production and is the only one that the Portal will load by default. Also known as configuration or configuration file.   | 
| hotfix                       | |
| idempotent                   | An operation whose result does not change after the initial application. For example, if the client needs to retry a request due to intermittent network issues, the same value will be sent to the server.  This allows the server to ignore the retry if it has already been processed. Even if the request is ignored, the same response will be returned if the client needs the values in the response. |
| localhost                    | A hostname that means this computer or this host.  |
| obsolete script              | A script that makes certain parts of the Portal act as legacy code, in order to limit the performance costs of the old functionality to only extensions that are using them. |

| query string                 | `uri` used for accessing the Azure Portal. The part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that contains data. Query strings are generated by form submission, or by being entered into the address bar of the browser after the URL. The  query string is specified by the values following the question mark (?). The values are used in Web processing, along with the path component of the URL. Query strings should not be used to transfer large amounts of data.  | 
| sandboxed iframe             | Enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe.  It can treat the content as being from a unique origin, block form submission or script execution, prevent links from targeting other browsing context, and other items that restrict the behavior of the iframe during testing. | 
| SAN                          | Storage Area Network  | 
| sideloading                  | Loading an extension for a specific user session from any source other than the uri that is registered in the Portal.  The process of transferring data between two local devices, or between the development platform and the local host. Also side load, side-load. | 
| synthetic traffic            | Traffic that has been created with a traffic generators and that behaves like real traffic. It can be used to capture the behavior the network or device under test. |
