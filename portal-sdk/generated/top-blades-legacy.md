## Legacy Blades

A blade is the vertical container that acts as the starting point for any journey. You can define multiple blades, each of which contains a collection of statically defined lenses and parts.

**NOTE**: Given the complexity associated with this model, extension authors are encouraged to use TemplateBlades instead, as specified in [portalfx-blades-overview.md](portalfx-blades-overview.md).

The following image contains a legacy blade.

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory, and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory, based on where the samples were installed when the developer set up the SDK. If there is a working copy of the sample in the Dogfood environment, it is also included.

Blades can be created in any PDL file. They are aggregated at compile time into the extension definition, as in the code located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Blades\Locked\Locked.pdl`. The code is also in the following example.

```xml
<Blade Name="LockedBlade"
       ViewModel="LockedBladeViewModel">
    <Lens>
        ...
    </Lens>
</Blade>
```

Blades use ViewModels to drive dynamic content, including titles, icons, and status.  The following is a list of legacy blade subtopics.
