<a name="portal-development-phase-2-development-development-procedures-network-with-support-teams"></a>
### Network with support teams
 
1. To ensure that the business goals of the new extension or service are aligned with Azure's business strategy, please reach out to the Integrated Marketing Team or the L&R - Operations - GD&F team at [mailto:ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com?subject=Azure%20Business%20model%20review](mailto:ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com?subject=Azure%20Business%20model%20review). Brian Hillger’s team and Stacey Ellingson’s team will guide you through the business model review process. The extension or service is not ready to be onboarded to Azure until its business model has received approval from those teams. Do not proceed with the next step until the business model has received approval.

1. Schedule a UX feasibility review with the Ibiza team UX contact by emailing [mailto:ibiza-onboarding@microsoft.com?subject=Extension%20Feasibility%20Review](mailto:ibiza-onboarding@microsoft.com?subject=Extension%20Feasibility%20Review).  Many extensions have been made more successful by setting up early design reviews with the Azure Portal team. Taking the time to review the design gives extension owners an opportunity to understand how they can leverage Azure Portal design patterns, and ensure that the desired outcome is feasible. 

1. If the extension requires additional built-in support for standard Graph or ARM APIs, submit a partner request at the site located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice).  For information about other components that the new service needs, see [portalfx-extensions-contacts.md](portalfx-extensions-contacts.md).

1. Start the CSS onboarding process with the CSS team at least three months previous to public preview. This process may coincide with the following step. For more information about development phases, see [portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md](portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md).

<a name="portal-development-phase-2-development-development-procedures-develop-the-extension"></a>
### Develop the extension

1. Build the extension and sideload it for local testing. Sideloading allows the testing and debugging of the extension locally against any environment. This is the preferred method of testing. For more information about sideloading, see [portalfx-extensions-sideloading-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-sideloading-overview.md) and [portalfx-testinprod.md](portalfx-testinprod.md). 

1. Complete the development and unit testing of the extension. For more information on debugging, see [portalfx-debugging.md](portalfx-debugging.md) and [portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md](portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md).

1. Address the exit criteria to meet previous to moving the extension to the next development phase. The exit criteria are located at [top-exit-criteria.md](top-exit-criteria.md).

1. Create configuration files for the extension as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md).

## Status Codes and Error Messages
Status codes or error messages that are encountered while developing an extension may be dependent on the type of extension that is being created, or the development phase in which the message is encountered.  Terms that are encountered in the error messages may be defined in the [Glossary](portalfx-extensions-glossary-status-codes.md).
<!-- TODO:  Find at least one status code for each of these conditions. -->

ERROR: The Portal displays a 520 error, as in the following image.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-debugging/failure.png "Portal Error Message")

The Web server is returning an unknown error. 

SOLUTION: Use the following troubleshooting steps.

* Check the browser console, and look for errors that describe the error condition in more detail. 
* Click on the failed part. With some types of errors, this will add a stack trace to the browser console.
* Double check the Knockout template for correct syntax.
* Ensure that all variables that are used in the template are public properties on the corresponding view model class.
* Reset the desktop state.
* Enable first chance exceptions in the JavaScript debugger.
* Set break points inside the viewModel constructor to ensure no errors are thrown.

### Onboarding FAQ

***Where are the onboarding FAQs for Sparta (ARM/CSM-RP)?***

The SharePoint Sparta Onboarding FAQ is located at [http://sharepoint/sites/AzureUX/Sparta/SpartaWiki/Sparta%20Onboarding%20FAQ.aspx](http://sharepoint/sites/AzureUX/Sparta/SpartaWiki/Sparta%20Onboarding%20FAQ.aspx).

<a name="portal-development-phase-2-development-frequently-asked-questions-ssl-certs"></a>
### SSL Certs
   
   <!-- TODO:  FAQ Format is ###Link, ***title***, Description, Solution, 3 Asterisks -->
   
***How do I use SSL certs?***
 
 SSL Certs are relevant only for teams that host their own extensions.  Azure Portal ONLY supports loading extensions from HTTPS URLs. Use a wildcard SSL cert for each environment to simplify maintenance, for example,   ``` *.<extensionName>.onecloud-ext.azure-test.net  ``` or  ``` *.<extensionName>.ext.azure.com) ``` .    To simplify overall management when your team is building separate, independent extensions, you can also use  ``` <extensionName>.<team>.ext.azure.com ``` and create a wildcard SSL cert for  ``` *.<team>.ext.azure.com ```. Internal teams can create SSL certs for the DogFood environment using the SSL Administration Web page that is located at [http://ssladmin](http://ssladmin). 
 
  Production certs must follow your organization’s PROD cert process. 

 **NOTE** Do not use the SSL Admin site for production certs.

 ### Compile on Save

**What is Compile on Save ?**

Compile on Save is a **TypeScript** option that   . To use it, make sure that **TypeScript** 2.0.3 was installed on your machine. The version can be verified by executing the following  command:

```bash
$>tsc -version
```
Then, verify that when a **TypeScript** file is saved, that the following text is displayed in the bottom left corner of your the **Visual Studio** application.
