# FileUpload
Drag and drop is an efficient, intuitive feature to move or copy objects between locations. This control enables drag and drop of files from the underlying platform's file manager on to the portal application.

## Best Practices

| What to do  | When to use |
|-------------|-------------|
| Along with drag & drop always have a link as an alternate way to browse files. | The experience requires frequent or mutiple files to be uploaded often by a user.|
| Include progress bar for long running operation to keep the users informed about the status.| User would benefit with a preview of what is getting uploaded, like a image, pdf or doc thumbnail.|
| Indicate success status after upload is complete.| If the form is complex and you are constrained by space, use the standard upload control.|
| Feel free to embed links in the message that help users solve the problem. 
| Show the name of the file uploaded. Optionally show preview of file depending on its type, ex: logo image, pdf, doc etc.
| If there is a limitation of size or file type that can be uploaded, communicate beforehand in the initial state rather than throw an error later.
| Make sure errors and parsed and notified back with appropriate actionable text.
| Whenever possible, let people undo drag and drop
