## Using Fx/Controls in EditScope backed forms

Several new Azure controls are compatible with EditScope-backed controls. 
This process specifies how to add the editscopeless **Name**  TextBox control from the `Fx/Controls/TextBox` module to an EditScope-based control. 

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory, and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory, based on where the samples were installed when the developer set up the SDK. 

This procedure uses the EngineV3 sample that is located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\Create\EngineV3\ViewModels.ts`.  The  control is also included in the working sample located at  [https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/#blade/SamplesExtension/SampleMenuBlade/createengine](https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/#blade/SamplesExtension/SampleMenuBlade/createengine).

For more information about the create engine, see [portalfx-create-engine-sample.md](portalfx-create-engine-sample.md).


1. Import modules

    All new controls are located in `Fx/Controls` namespace. Use the following snippet to import the `TextBox` module into your code.

    ```ts 
    import * as TextBox from "Fx/Controls/TextBox";
    import * as Validations from "Fx/Controls/Validations"
    ```

1. Modify textBox type

    Change the control type for the name of the engine so that it is using the editscopeless TextBox.

    ```ts
    /**
    * The view model for the form element for the engine name.
    **/
    public engineName: TextBox.Contract;
    ```


1. Modify Control Initialization

    The `engineName` is initialized inside the `_initializeFormFields` function. Controls inside the `Fx/Controls` namespace use the following factory pattern for initialization.

    ```ts
    this.engineName = TextBox.create(container, {
        label: ClientResources.engineNameColumn,
        subLabel: ClientResources.sampleSubLabel,
        placeHolderText: ClientResources.enterEngineName,
        validations: ko.observableArray([
            new Validations.Required(ClientResources.emptyFirstName),
            new Validations.RegExMatchValidation("^[a-zA-Z]+", ClientResources.startsWithLetterValidationMessage),
            // The 'Reserved Resource Name Validator' makes sure the engine name is not a trademark or reserved word.
            new Validations.ReservedResourceNameValidator(resourceType)
        ])
    });
    ```

1. Modify the logic to see initial data in EditScope

    After the data is received, the sample invokes  `_mapIncomingDataForEditScope` to initialize the data in the editScope.  Because the new controls are not tied to editScope, the value of the control is set explicitly.

    Initialize the `dataModel`, and then initialize the value of the TextBox with the following line of code.
    
    ```ts
    this.engineName.value(data.name || "");
    ```

1. Modify the action bar valid computation

   In order to modify the `valid` computation, the existing logic that was used to validate the state of action bar is removed.  It is replaced by the following logic that computes validation using the editScope, along with validation for new TextBox.

    ```ts
    ko.computed<boolean>(container, () => {
                this.actionBar.valid(this.valid() && this.engineName.valid());
    });
    ```
1. Modify ARM provisioner to use value from new control

    The `_supplyTemplateDeploymentOptions` provides the  ARM provisioner with the template deployment options.
    Because  the form is not backed by editscope we need to change the way the value of Engine name is sent to the template, as in the following example.

    ```ts
    var engineName = this.engineName.value(); 
    ```

When this procedure is complete, all the changes that are required for an EditScope-backed form to work with editscope-less controls have been added.
