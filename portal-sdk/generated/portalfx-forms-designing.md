## Designing and Arranging the Form

<a name="designing-and-arranging-the-form-the-section-viewmodel"></a>
### The section viewModel

While blade templates allow manual layout of controls as specific DOM elements, the generally recommended approach is to bind a section `viewModel` into the DOM and then add control `viewModels` to the `children` observable array of the section. For example, the following image contains two sections with varying numbers of child objects in their respective arrays.

The section `viewModel` provides default styling for spacing and margins and is an easy way to dynamically add and remove controls.

### The <code>CustomHtml</code> control

The `CustomHtml` control can be used to author HTML in an autogenerated layout. Many extensions use these
two controls to avoid large amounts of HTML in the blade template. However, placing the controls in the DOM manually is always an option if needed.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether "two controls" means the section viewModel and the customHtml control.

To use a section, create a section ViewModel and bind it into the DOM in the blade template using the `pcControl` binding handler. Then add all the controls that should be displayed into the `children` observable array of the section. This positions the controls sequentially on a blade, by default. 

The section's `style` property can be used to achieve other layouts. This includes table layouts that display controls in multiple rows and columns, as a list of tabs, or as a combination of layouts.

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK. Clicking on the following link will display a working copy of a basic Portal form.

Click on 'Basic Create Form' to view an example of basic form creation. The code to create the section is located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\BasicCreate\ViewModels\Parts\FormsSampleBasicCreatePart.ts`.

The following template binds the section into the DOM, and will autogenerate the layout for all of the child objects.

```typescript

const mySectionOptions: Section.Options = {
    children: ko.observableArray<any>([
        this.myTextBox,
        this.myChecklessTextBox,
        this.myPasswordBox,
        this.myGroupDropDown,
        myDependentSection,
        this.myCheckBox,
        this.mySelector,
        this.myDropDown,
    ])
};
this.mySection = new Section.ViewModel(this._container, mySectionOptions);

```
and 
```
ï»¿<div class="msportalfx-form" data-bind="pcControl: mySection"></div>
```
