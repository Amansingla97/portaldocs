# NuGet Packages

The Azure Portal SDK ships framework assemblies, tools, test framework and extension [PDE](portalfx-extensions-glossary-onboarding.md) files as NuGet packages. It also provides the capability to ship extensions as NuGet packages. This allows extensions to invoke blades and parts from other extensions at runtime. For more information about sharing  extensions as NuGet packages, see [portalfx-pde-publish.md](portalfx-pde-publish.md).

## Configure NuGet package sources for development

In order to download the NuGet packages as part of an extension, developers can choose between CoreXT compatible package sources or consume the packages installed locally by the MSI. Choose a configuration that applies to your extension development context.

### Microsoft Internal NuGet Feed

Portal SDK NuGet packages are published to the following Microsoft internal NuGet feed. `https://msazure.pkgs.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_apis/packaging/Official/nuget/index.json`
Depending on your internal build system the configuration of how to consume this feed will vary.  For the latest guidance on consuming the above feed within your build system consult your build systems documentation. For those using 1ES systems see the NuGet in 1ES guide.

### Getting the NuGet packages externally

PortalSDK NuGet packages are only published to Microsoft internal NuGet feeds.  If you do not have access to those feeds such as the one mentioned above you will need use the Portal MSI to deliver NuGet packages to your development machines.  This is the recommended path for third party extension developers.

Installing the Portal SDK MSI will unpack the NuGet packages to a default location of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\PortalSDK\packages` and will setup a NuGet package source named PortalSDK that points to that location.  Any subsequent actions performed in Visual Studio or the NuGet command line will also search the new local PortalSDK feed in program files for Portal-related NuGet packages.

## Updating your extension to a newer version of the SDK

<a name="nuget-packages-updating-your-extension-to-a-newer-version-of-the-sdk-update-your-nuget-packages"></a>
### Update your NuGet Packages

	In Visual Studio
		a. Install the latest version of the Portal SDK MSI
		b. In Visual Studio select `Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet packages for Solutionâ€¦`
		c. Select all Microsoft.Portal.* NuGet packages
		d. Click Update
		e. Build and fix any Breaking Changes
	In CoreXT
		a. Find the latest SDK version number from the SDK Downloads.
		b. Update your package.config to the latest version of the SDK found in step 1.
		c. run init.cmd
			i. Note: your $(Pkg*) references  in your csproj should automatically update to point at the newest restored NuGet.
		d. Copy over /Content files to get latest *.d.ts and *.pde files
			i. Note: CoreXT does not copy content files. Commonly internal teams use either a <Target /> or NuGetContentRestore task to rehydrate the Content files from their CxCache.
		e. Build and fix any Breaking Changes

### [Optional] Update the pdl XSD

TODO: would need a separate path of shipping the XSD to provide another path here where they don't need to update the SDK.

**NOTE**:  `<repoRootPath>`, without the angle brackets, is the path to the extension repository on the development computer.

## Available NuGet Packages

NuGet packages are separated into the following categories.

* [Development](#development)
* [Publishing in the marketplace](#publishing-in-the-marketplace)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Deprecated packages](#deprecated-packages)

The following sections describe the various NuGet packages by category.

<a name="nuget-packages-available-nuget-packages-development"></a>
### Development

After installation, NuGet packages that are used for development are listed in the `NuGet Package Manager` tool in the **Visual Studio** project for the extension that is being built.
   
| Package | Purpose | 
| ------- | ------- |
| Microsoft.Portal.Framework | Contains framework assemblies Microsoft.Portal.Azure.dll, Microsoft.Portal.Core.dll,Microsoft.Portal.Framework.dll, Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.dll and WindowsAzureEventSource.dll.  |
| Microsoft.Portal.Security.AadCore | Contains AAD module used for auth Microsoft.Portal.AadCore.dll | 
| Microsoft.Portal.TypeMetadata  | Contains both runtime and compile time components that drive reflection-style features for the Azure Portal SDK.  This includes the compile time generation of C# model interfaces into TypeScript interfaces, and the injection of type information into the portal at runtime. | 
| Microsoft.Portal.Tools | Contains PDC, Target files (.target) , [Definition files](portalfx-extensions-glossary-onboarding.md) and TypeScript 2.0.3 compiler. | 
| Microsoft.Portal.Tools.ContentUnbundler | Contains the tool that packages an extension UI into a zip file which can be served by the hosting service. | 

<a name="nuget-packages-available-nuget-packages-publishing-in-the-marketplace"></a>
### Publishing in the marketplace

| Package | Purpose | 
| ------- | ------- |
| Microsoft.Azure.Gallery.AzureGalleryUtility | Contains tools to package, upload and update gallery items in the Azure Portal marketplace. | 

<a name="nuget-packages-available-nuget-packages-testing"></a>
### Testing

| Package | Purpose | 
| ------- | ------- |
| Microsoft.Portal.TestFramework | Allows use of UI-based test cases with **Selenium** and **Visual Studio**. For more information about using the test framework, see [top-extensions-csharp-test-framework.md](top-extensions-csharp-test-framework.md). | 
| Microsoft.Portal.TestFramework.UnitTest | Unit Test framework. For more information about unit testing,  see [portalfx-unit-test.md](portalfx-unit-test.md). | 

<a name="nuget-packages-available-nuget-packages-deprecated-packages"></a>
### Deprecated packages

The following NuGet packages have been deprecated. Do not use these packages when building new extensions. If the packages were used in local development, please reach out to the <a href="mailto:IbizaFxPM@microsoft.com?subject=Migration to Sideloading">IbizaFxPM team</a> for assistance with migration to sideloading.

| Package | Purpose | 
| ------- | ------- |
| Microsoft.Portal.Azure.Website | Contains the Authenticated Developer Portal Website with Hubs and Billing Extensions. | 
| Microsoft.Portal.Azure.WebsiteNoAuth | Contains the Unauthenticated Developer Portal Website. | 
| Microsoft.Portal.Framework.Scripts | Deprecated, use Microsoft.Portal.TestFramework.UnitTest instead, as specified in  [portalfx-unit-test.md](portalfx-unit-test.md).  | 
| Microsoft.Portal.Tools.Etw | Provides the **EtwRelatedFilesUtility.exe** tool and sample configurations for developers who are self-hosting extensions. The recommended practice is to use the extension hosting service as specified in [top-extensions-hosting-service.md](top-extensions-hosting-service.md) instead of custom deployment, as specified in [top-extensions-custom-deployment.md](top-extensions-custom-deployment.md).  | 

<a name="nuget-packages-invoking-other-extensions-at-runtime"></a>
## Invoking other extensions at runtime

An extension can refer to another extension's NuGet packages in order to invoke its blades or parts at runtime. For more information about available PDE's, see [portalfx-extension-sharing-pde.md](portalfx-extension-sharing-pde.md).

**NOTE**: The list of NuGet packages that contain extensions is contributed to by extension developers who ship the packages. Absence of an extension package from the list does not imply that the package does not exist, or does not ship. To verify whether an extension ships a NuGet package, reach out to the respective teams at  [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice)  or [portalfx-extensions-contacts](portalfx-extensions-contacts).
