## Best Practices

1. Design and code your extension with accessibility in mind  

1. Use Portal tiles/parts, forms, and controls whenever possible, as those are designed to be accessible

1. Use HTML semantics when using custom HTML, as described in [http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp). For example, create buttons with the `BUTTON`  tag instead of a  styled `DIV` tag.

1. Avoid using `aria-*`  attributes.  If you find yourself using those attributes, review your design and try to use HTML semantics as much as possible.

1. Provide concise, meaningful instructions for user input.

1. Scrub your content for consistent terminology and iconography before releasing it to the public

1. Always use multiple sensory cues to convey information. Never use the position, orientation, size, shape, or color  of a UI element alone to communicate important information to the user.
