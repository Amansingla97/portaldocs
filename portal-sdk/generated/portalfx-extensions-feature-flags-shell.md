## Shell feature flags

The Ibiza Fx team supports the following feature flags, or Shell feature flags. These flags are only available to the Shell, unless they are configured to be shared. Unless otherwise noted, a value of `true` enables the feature, and a value of `false` disables it. 

There are three naming conventions for feature flags. Some feature flags have their own names, like **hubsextension_showserverevents** or `https://portal.azure.com/?<featureName>=<value>`; however, the syntax for most feature flags assumes they are a property of the feature object, in which case they are invoked with the  syntax: `https://portal.azure.com/?feature.<featureName>=true`. Otherwise, they are directives to the extension, in which case the syntax is `<extensionName>_<flagName>=<value>`. For more information about developer-specified feature flags in extensions, see [portalfx-extensions-feature-flags-developer.md](portalfx-extensions-feature-flags-developer.md).
<!-- TODO:  Determine whether hubsextension_showserverevents is the showserverevents feature flag for the hubsextension extension.  -->
<!--TODO: can an extension name contain capital letters or special characters? -->
<!--TODO: can the canmodifystamps flag ever be required or included when it is false?  -->
<!--TODO: is the canmodifystamps always required when extensionName is used? -->

The keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+D toggles the visibility of the debug tool, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-debugging-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-debugging-overview.md). The yellow sticky that is located at the bottom on the right side of the window can be used to toggle client optimizations and other shell feature flags.

### The extensionName flag

The name of the extension can be used as a feature flag. The extension name can contain any character in the ranges between [a-z] or [0-9]. 
<!--TODO: Determine whether all uses of the extensionName flag require the 'canmodifystamps` flag. -->
Requires the `canmodifystamps` flag to contain a value of `true` in order to be in effect. Used to enable or disable an extension, use different configuration stamps, and provide other run-time functionality.  A value of `true` will temporarily enable a disabled extension, and allows the use of other flags. A value of `false` will temporarily disable the extension and leave it in hidden mode, as in the following example: `https://portal.azure.com?Microsoft_Azure_DevTestLab=true`.  For more information, see [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md).

The name of the extension can be used in the query string to access various Shell flags. These are flags that are independent of the **canmodifystamps** flag.

```js
   &<extensionName>=true,[<otherShellFlags>]
```
 How to use the flags that are within the extension is specified in [portalfx-extensions-feature-flags-developer.md](portalfx-extensions-feature-flags-developer.md);  The Shell flags are in the following table.
    
  <!--TODO:  Validate that the parameters are used correctly.  -->

  | Directive | Use | 
  | --------- | --- |
  | webworker | A value of `true` enables webworkers in the portal for all extensions who have explicitly been set as supporting webworkers in the `extensions.json` file. For example, `webworker=true,Microsoft_Azure_Demo=true,extName=<id>` will allow the webworker whose id is specified in `extName` to use the extension named Microsoft_Azure_Demo. 




<a name="shell-feature-flags-the-canmodifystamps-flag"></a>
### The canmodifystamps flag

The **canmodifystamps** flag is used in conjunction with the **extensionName** parameter to pass developer-specified values to the extension, to specify which stage or build number to use, and other purposes. When the **canmodifystamps** flag is set to true, the following run options can be enabled.

* Use a secondary test stamp, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#extension-stamps](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#extension-stamps). If the developer is using a secondary test stamp, enter one of the following into the query string immediately after the **canmodifystamps** flag.
 ```js
   &<extensionName>=<stageName>
   &<extensionName>=<buildNumber>
   &<extensionName>=<uriFormatPrefix> 
 ```
  * **extensionName**: The name of the extension.

    * **stageName**:  The stage that represents a datacenter, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading](portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading). Use the name that is deployed to a specific stage, for example, stage1.
    * **buildNumber**:  The build number as specified in [portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading](portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading). Replace the dots in the build number with the letter 'd', so that build number 1.0.8.31â€¯is represented by 1d0d8d31.
    * **uriFormatPrefix**: The value to use when building the **uriFormat** string. For example, when **uriFormat** is `//{0}.devtest.ext.azure.com`, the query string `https://portal.azure.com?feature.canmodifystamps=true&Microsoft_Azure_DevTestLab=perf` would cause  the `{0}` in the **uriFormat** string to be replaced with `perf` and attempt to load the extension from `https://perf.devtest.ext.azure.com`.
    
 * Create custom deployment environments, as specified in [portalfx-deployment.md](portalfx-deployment.md).

<!--TODO: Validate that this information from the OneNote document is current. -->
**webworker**: Used in conjunction with **microsoft_azure_compute**. Enables the webworkers for all extensions that have explicitly set supporting webworkers, and forces **microsoft_azure_compute** into a web worker. For example, `feature.webworker=true,microsoft_azure_compute` can be added to the query string. Useful for testing extensions manually or through CI previous to enabling them in production.  

<!-- before flipping the switch.-->

<!-- TODO:  Find a name for the feature flags that are not invoked with the "feature.<name> syntax. -->

<a name="shell-feature-flags-features-other-than-the-feature-object"></a>
### Features other than the <code>feature</code> object

**hubsextension_showserverevents**:  Automatically shows all error and warning events as notifications.

**clientOptimizations**: Turns off bundling and minification of JavaScript to make debugging easier.    A value of `true` turns on bundling and minification,  and a value of `false` turns them both off. A value of `bundle` turns off JavaScript minification but retains bundling so the Portal still loads fairly quickly.  The value `bundle` is the suggested value for Portal extension debugging. 

<!-- Determine whether the following note is what was meant by "The 'bundle' value turns off JavaScript minification but retains bundling so the Portal still loads fairly quickly (which it doesn't for 'false' when bundling is turned off and many loose JavaScript files are loaded).". -->

**NOTE**:  A value of  `false` turns off bundling, but does not unload JavaScript files that were loaded.  
**Recommendation**:  When debugging an extension, the developer should supply `false` for this flag to disable script minification and to turn on additional diagnostics.

  **NOTE**:  This applies to both the portal and extensions source. If testing extensions that are already deployed to production, use the **clientOptimizations** flag instead of the ***IsDevelopmentMode** appSetting. If working in a development environment instead, use the ***IsDevelopmentMode** appSetting instead of the **clientOptimizations** flag to turn off bundling and minification for this extension only. This will speed up portal load during development and testing.  To change the ***IsDevelopmentMode** appSetting, locate the appropriate `web.config` file and change the value of the ***IsDevelopmentMode** appSetting to `true`.

<!--TODO:  Determine whether microsoft_azure_marketplace is an extension name or an example extension name.  If such is the case, then the following 4 flags should be documented as only the suffix name. -->

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_Curation**:  Associated with Marketplace extensions. Uses a named curation  . For more information about curations, see   .

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_curation**: Associated with Marketplace extensions. Uses a named curation . For more information about curations, see   .

<!--TODO:  Determine whether microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey is different from microsoft_azure_marketplace_itemhidekey. -->

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_itemhidekey**: Associated with Marketplace extensions. Shows specified Marketplace items that are otherwise hidden, or shows unpublished items in the gallery. A value of `true` shows the item,  and a value of `false` hides it. Used in conjunction with **extensionName** when the extension is enabled. For example, if the hidekey is `DevTestLabHidden`,the following will display the extension in the "Create New" experience while it is enabled.
`https://portal.azure.com?<extensionName>=true&microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=DevTestLabHidden`.

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_quotaIdOverride**:  Associated with Marketplace extensions and the Create Launcher. A value of `true` ,  and a value of `false`. 

  **nocdn**: A value of `true` will bypass the CDN when loading resources for the portal only. A value of `force` will bypass the CDN when loading resources for the portal and all extensions.

**testExtensions**: Contains the name of the extension, and the environment in which the extension is located. For example, `?testExtensions={"HelloWorld":"https://localhost:44300/"}` specifies the intent to load the `HelloWorld` extension from the localhost port 44300 into the current session of the portal. The **name** and **uri**  parameters are as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#understanding-the-extension-configuration-in-portal](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#understanding-the-extension-configuration-in-portal).
