## Introduction 

It is important you read this guide carefully, as we rely on you to manage your extension registration / configuration management in the portal repository. External partners should also read this guide to understand the capabilities that Portal can provide for your extension through configuration. However, external partner requests should be submitted by sending emails instead of using the internal sites that are mentioned in this document.
