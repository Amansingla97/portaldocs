### Register the extension

Once the name of the extension or service name is finalized, request to have the extension registered in all environments. Registering an extension in Portal requires deployment so it can take almost 10 days in the Production environment. Please plan accordingly.

* For internal partners, the request to register an extension is a pull request, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-publishing.md](portalfx-extensions-publishing.md).
 
* External teams can submit their requests by sending an email that resembles the following image.

* After deploying the extension to the DOGFOOD (DF) environment, contact the Fx team to request that they enable the extension, if applicable. Every extension  meets required exit criteria / quality metrics before it will be enabled. The  extension will be enabled in production once all exit criteria have been met.

   Extension names must use standard extension name format, as in the example located at [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#name](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#name).

* Extension URLs must use a standard CNAME pattern. For more information about CNAMES, see [portalfx-extensions-cnames.md](portalfx-extensions-cnames.md).
