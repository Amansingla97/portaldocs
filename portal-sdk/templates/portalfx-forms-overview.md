# Developing Forms

The Azure SDK includes extensive support for displaying and managing user input. Forms are created using `HTML` templates, `ViewModels`, and `EditScopes`. Developers can use standard `HTML` and **Knockout** to build forms, in addition to the following items for which  the SDK Framework includes support.

  * Labels
  * Validation, as in the following image

  * Persisting edits across journeys and browser sessions
