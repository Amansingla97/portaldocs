# Developing Forms

The Azure SDK includes extensive support for displaying and managing user input. Forms are created using HTML templates, view models, and edit scopes. Developers can use standard HTML and **Knockout** to build their forms, in addition to the following items for which  the SDK framework includes support.

  * Labels
  * Validation, as in the following image

  * Persisting edits across journeys and browser sessions

In the following tables, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to Dogfood copies of sample experiences are included in the tables as appropriate.
