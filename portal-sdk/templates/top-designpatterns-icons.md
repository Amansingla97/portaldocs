# How to prepare icons
This page covers how to properly export an icon that you've created in Illustrator to use in the Azure portal. Illustrator provides several ways to save a file as an SVG but this is the recommended method.

1. Make sure the colors you used are in the approved color palette

</div>

## Don't
 - Keep artwork on multiple layers, like this
 <div style="max-width:400px">
