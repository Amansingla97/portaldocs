## Resource menu APIs

The `MsPortalFx.Assets` is the interface for the resource menu API. It also contains the menu API's and the Selectable 2 APIs.  They are located in the `MsPortalFx.d.ts` file or the `Fx.d.ts`  of the project IDE. They are also located in  `<dir>\Definitions` directory of the SDK, where `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory, based on where the samples were installed when the developer set up the SDK.

<!-- TODO: Determine whether an  API Reference code generator will be available to first-party developers, or if this type of information can be made available in a tool like the playground. -->
