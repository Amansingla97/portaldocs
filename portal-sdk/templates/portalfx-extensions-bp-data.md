## Best Practices 

### Use QueryCache and EntityCache

When performing data access from your view models, it may be tempting to make data calls directly from the `onInputsSet` function. By using the `QueryCache` and `EntityCache` objects from the `DataCache` class, you can control access to data through a single component. A single ref-counted cache can hold data across your entire extension.  This has the following benefits.

* Reduced memory consumption
* Lazy loading of data
* Less calls out to the network
* Consistent UX for views over the same data.

**NOTE**: Developers should use the `DataCache` objects `QueryCache` and `EntityCache` for data access. These classes provide advanced caching and ref-counting. Internally, these make use of Data.Loader and Data.DataSet (which will be made FX-internal in the future).

### Avoid unnecessary data reloading

As users navigate through the Ibiza UX, they will frequently revisit often-used resources within a short period of time.
They might visit their favorite Website Blade, browse to see their Subscription details, and then return to configure/monitor their
favorite Website. In such scenarios, ideally, the user would not have to wait through loading indicators while Website data reloads.

To optimize for this scenario, use the `extendEntryLifetimes` option common to QueryCache and EntityCache.

```ts

public websitesQuery = new MsPortalFx.Data.QueryCache<SamplesExtension.DataModels.WebsiteModel, any>({
    entityTypeName: SamplesExtension.DataModels.WebsiteModelType,
    sourceUri: MsPortalFx.Data.uriFormatter(Shared.websitesControllerUri),
    supplyData: (method, uri, headers, data) => {
        // ...
    },
    extendEntryLifetimes: true
});

```

QueryCache/EntityCache contain numerous cache entries, each of which are ref-counted based on not-disposed instances of
QueryView/EntityView. When a user closes a Blade, typically a cache entry in the corresponding QueryCache/EntityCache will be removed,
since all QueryView/EntityView instances will have been disposed. In the scenario where the user *revisits* their Website Blade,
the corresponding cache entry will have to be reloaded via an ajax call, and the user will be subjected to loading indicators on
the Blade and its Parts.

With `extendEntryLifetimes`, unreferenced cache entries will be *retained for some amount of time*, so when a corresponding Blade
is reopened, data for the Blade and its Parts will already be loaded and cached.  Here, calls to `this._view.fetch()` from a Blade
or Part view model will return a resolved Promise, and the user will not see long-running loading indicators.

(Note - The time that unreferenced cache entries are retained in QueryCache/EntityCache is controlled centrally by the FX
 and the timeout will be tuned based on telemetry to maximize cache efficiency across extensions.)

For your scenario to make use of `extendEntryLifetimes`, it is **very important** that you take steps to keep your client-side
QueryCache/EntityCache data caches **consistent with server data**.
See [Reflecting server data changes on the client](portalfx-data-configuringdatacache.md) for details.
