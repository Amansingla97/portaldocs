## The DataCache class

The cache objects are a collection of cache entries. In extensions that use multiple active blades and parts, a specific cache object might contain many cache entries.  This means that multiple parts or services can rely on the same set of data. For queries, this may be a list of results, whereas for a details blade, it may be a single entity. In either case, it is critical to ensure that all parts that share a specific set of data perform the following actions.

1. Use a single HTTP request to access that data
1. Read from a single cache of data in memory
1. Release that data from memory when it is no longer required

These are all features that the `DataCache` class provides. The Azure Portal `MsPortalFx.Data` class objects are `QueryCache`, `EntityCache` and the `EditScopeCache`. The `DataCache` classes all share the same API. 

<!--TODO: Determine whether it is more accurate to say the following sentence.
The `DataCache` objects all share the same class within the API.   -->
  
They are a full-featured way of loading and caching data used by blade and part `ViewModels`.  The `QueryCache` object queries for a collection of data, whereas the `EntityCache` object loads an individual entity. 
 
### Using the DataCache class

Use the following steps to create a blade or part that uses the `DataCache` class. 

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and `<dirParent>` is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to the Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether there is a better sample that illustrates the points in the content, specifically the load and refresh points. -->

1. In a `DataContext`, the extension creates and configures `DataCache` instances. Configuring the instance specifies how to load data when it is missing from the cache and how to implicitly refresh cached data, to keep it consistent with the server state. The following `WebsiteQuery` example includes a constructor for a Website extension that creates a data cache. The code is also located at `<dir>Client\V1\Data\MasterDetailBrowse\MasterDetailBrowseData.ts`.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether this is the sample that is causing the npm run docs build to blow up. -->

  gitdown": "include-section", "file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Data/MasterDetailBrowse/MasterDetailBrowseData.ts", "section": "data-overview#create-data-cache"} 

2. Each blade and part `ViewModel` creates a `DataView` in its constructor, so that it can load and refresh data for the blade or part.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether this is the sample that is causing the npm run docs build to blow up. -->

  gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/MasterDetail/MasterDetailBrowse/ViewModels/DetailViewModels.ts", "section": "data#entityCacheView"}

3. When the blade or part `ViewModel` receives its parameters in the `onInputsSet` method, the `ViewModel` calls the  `dataView.fetch()` method to load data.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether this is the sample that is causing the npm run docs build to blow up. -->

### The QueryCache

The `QueryCache` object is used to query for a collection of data or cache a list of items. It is useful for loading data for list-like views like Grid, List, Tree, or Chart. It takes a generic parameter for the type of object stored in its cache, and a type for the object that defines the query. It loads data of type `Array<T>` according to an extension-specified `TQuery` type.

The `QueryCache` parameters are as follows.

<!-- TODO: Determine whether the sourceURI and entityTypeName are required paramters.  Per the example given, the other parameters are optional. -->

**DataModels.WebsiteModel**: Optional. The model type for the website. This is usually auto-generated (see TypeMetadata section below).

**WebsiteQuery**: Optional. The type that defines the parameters for the query. This often will include sort order, filter parameters, paging data, etc.

**entityTypeName**: Provides the name of the metadata type. This is usually auto-generated (see TypeMetadata section below).

**sourceUri**: Provides the endpoint which will accept the HTTP request.

**poll**: Optional. A boolean field which determines whether entries in this cache should be refreshed on a timer.  You can use it in conjunction with property pollInterval can be used to override the default poll interval and pollPreservesClientOrdering can be used to preserve the client's existing record order when polling as opposed to using the order from the server response.

**supplyData**: Optional. Allows the extension to override the logic used to perform an AJAX request. Allows for making the AJAX call, and post-processing the data before it is placed into the cache.

In the example, when the `QueryCache` that contains the websites is created, two elements are specified.

1. **entityTypeName**: The name of the metadata type. The QueryCache needs to know the shape of the data contained in it, in order to handle the data appropriately. That information is specified with the entity type.

1. **sourceUri**: The endpoint that will accept the HTTP request. This function returns the URI to populate the cache. It is sent a set of parameters that are sent to a `fetch` call. In this case, `runningStatus` is the only parameter. Based on the presence of the `runningStatus` parameter, the URI is modified to query for the correct data.

<!-- TODO:  determine whether "presence" can be changed to "value". Did they mean true if present and false if absent, with false as the default value?  This sentence needs more information. -->

When all of these items are complete, the `QueryCache` is configured. It can be populated while Views that use the cache are being created, and the `fetch()` method is called. 

The sample located at  `<dir>Client\V1\Data\MasterDetailBrowse\MasterDetailBrowseData.ts` creates a `QueryCache` which polls the `sourceUri` endpoint on a timed interval. This code is also included in the following example.

```ts
export interface WebsiteQuery {
    runningStatus: boolean;
}

public websitesQuery = new MsPortalFx.Data.QueryCache<DataModels.WebsiteModel, WebsiteQuery>({
    entityTypeName: DataModels.WebsiteModelType,
    sourceUri: MsPortalFx.Base.Resources.getAppRelativeUri("/api/Websites?runningStatus={0}"),
    poll: true
});
```

### EntityCache
 
The `EntityCache` object can be used to cache a single item.  It is useful for loading data into property views and single-record views. 

<!-- Determine whether a template class can be specified as an object in the content.  Otherwise, find a more definitive term. -->

It accepts data of type `T` according to some extension-specified `TId` type. This specifies the type for the object that defines the query, as in the `WebsiteQuery` example located at `<dir>Client/V1/MasterDetail/MasterDetailArea.ts`. This code is also included in the following example.

<!-- TODO:  Determine whether this is the sample that is causing the npm run docs build to blow up. -->

  gitdown": "include-section", "file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/MasterDetail/MasterDetailArea.ts", "section": "data#websitesEntityCache"}

<!--TODO: Determine whether these parameters can be described as "
a generic parameter for the type of object stored in its cache, "  -->

When an EntityCache is instantiated, three elements are specified.

1. **entityTypeName**: The name of the metadata type. The EntityCache needs to know the shape of the data contained in it, in order to reason over the data.

1. **sourceUri**: The endpoint that will accept the HTTP request. This function returns the URI that the cache uses to get the data. It is sent a set of parameters that are sent to a `fetch` call. In this instance, the  `MsPortalFx.Data.uriFormatter()` helper method is used. It fills one or more parameters into the URI provided to it. In this instance there is only  one parameter, the `id` parameter, which is entered into the part of the URI containing `{id}`.

1. **findCachedEntity**: Optional. Allows the lookup of an entity from the `QueryCache`, instead of retrieving the data a second time from the server, which creates a second copy of the data on the client. This element also serves as a method, whose two properties are: 1) the `QueryCache` to use and 2) a function that, given an item from the QueryCache, will specify whether this is the object that was requested by the parameters to the `fetch()` call.
    
### EditScopeCache

The `EditScopeCache` class is less commonly used. It loads and manages instances of `EditScope`, which is a change-tracked, editable model for use in Forms, as specified in [portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md](portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md).
