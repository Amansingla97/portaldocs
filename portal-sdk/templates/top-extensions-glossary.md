Anyone in a flight group will receive packages that are designated for that particular group. Users  who are not in the flight group  will receive  packages that contain  the non-flighted  version of an extension. Eventually there will be only one version of the new extension, whereupon the customer base is expanded by adding flight groups or by releasing the successfully flighted bits to production.  |
