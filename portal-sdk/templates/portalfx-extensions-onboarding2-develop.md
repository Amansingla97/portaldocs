### Develop the extension

1. Build the extension and sideload it for local testing. Sideloading allows the testing and debugging of the extension locally against any environment. This is the preferred method of testing. For more information about sideloading, see [portalfx-extensions-sideloading-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-sideloading-overview.md) and [portalfx-testinprod.md](portalfx-testinprod.md). 

1. Complete the development and unit testing of the extension. For more information on debugging, see [portalfx-debugging.md](portalfx-debugging.md) and [portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md](portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md).

1. Address the exit criteria to meet previous to moving the extension to the next development phase. The exit criteria are located at [top-exit-criteria.md](top-exit-criteria.md).

1. Create configuration files for the extension as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md).
