## Status Codes and Error Messages
Status codes or error messages that are encountered while developing an extension may be dependent on the type of extension that is being created, or the development phase in which the message is encountered.  Terms that are encountered in the error messages may be defined in the [Glossary](portalfx-extensions-status-codes-glossary.md).

The Web server is returning an unknown error. 

SOLUTION: Use the following troubleshooting steps.

* Check the browser console, and look for errors that describe the error condition in more detail. 
* Click on the failed part. With some types of errors, this will add a stack trace to the browser console.
* Double check the Knockout template for correct syntax.
* Ensure that all variables that are used in the template are public properties on the corresponding view model class.
* Reset the desktop state.
* Enable first chance exceptions in the JavaScript debugger.
* Set break points inside the viewModel constructor to ensure no errors are thrown.
