## Overview
The Azure Portal SDK includes everything you need to build extensions for the portal. It includes a variety of tools and samples that help developers build extensions on top of the framework.

The software platform must have the most recent editions of operating systems and other software installed, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-forDevelopers-procedures.md#softwareInstall"](portalfx-extensions-forDevelopers-procedures.md#softwareInstall).
