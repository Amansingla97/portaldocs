## Introduction 

This document describes the creation of a blank Azure extension that validates that the developer's computer is ready for more portal development.
   
## Overview

Your development environment should have the most recent editions of operating systems and other software installed, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-onboarding-procedures.md#install-software](portalfx-extensions-onboarding-procedures.md#install-software).
