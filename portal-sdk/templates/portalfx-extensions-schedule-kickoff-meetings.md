### Schedule Kickoff Meetings
 
Reach out to the <a href="mailto:ibiza-onboarding-kick@microsoft.com?subject=Kickoff Meeting Request&body=My team would like to meet with you to learn about the Azure onboarding process.">Portal team</a> and request a kickoff meeting. A team representative will deliver a 30-minute overview of the onboarding process. We can direct you to the latest patterns and practices, talk about the relationship between our teams,  and answer questions.  

<!--TODO: Are the business model review and the feasibility study previous to or a  part of the kickoff meetings?  they are in the step-by-step named Develop and deploy the extension, and they seem to occur after the team is onboard but before the extension is developed. -->

Make sure the extension that will be developed has passed the business model review and is feasible previous to the kickoff meetings. For more information about business model reviews and feasibility studies, see .

Schedule and attend the kickoff meeting(s) hosted by your PM or Dev Lead. These meetings will touch on the following points.

* Whether the service will target public Azure, on-premises, or both
* What is the name of the service
* Summary of the service and target scenarios

If you are planning to build a first party application, i.e., you are a part of Microsoft, the meeting agenda will also include:
* VP, PM, and engineering owners
* Timelines (preview, GA)

When these meetings have concluded, your team will be ready to build extensions.
