## Essentials control

The essentials control is used for showing resource information with multiple properties.
First 5 items in left pane of the essentials are obtained by calling Azure Resource Manager APIs with given resource id.
More items can be specified in constructor or can be added dynamically later in both left and right panes.
It has flexibility to customize layout of properties in a column, to show properties for non-ARM resources, to responsively redistribute properties into 1 or 3+ columns when the Blade width shrinks or expands.
When there are more than 5 items in any panes, only first 5 items in each panes will be shown and rest of the items can be revealed when **See more** is clicked.
