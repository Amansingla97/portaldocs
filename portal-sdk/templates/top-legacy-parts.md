# Parts
   
## Overview

Parts, also known as tiles, are a framework feature that integrates the UI of an extension on dashboards.  Parts were more prevalent on blades, but this older pattern is being obsoleted by TemplateBlades that do not contain parts. For more information about template blades, see [top-extensions-blades.md](top-extensions-blades.md).

Intrinsic parts are composed of existing controls in the portal, and provide patterns for solving common patterns in the portal.

Many of the intrinsics can be found in the playground located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/playground](https://aka.ms/portalfx/playground).

The remainder of them can be located in the working copy located at  [https://aka.ms/portalfx/samples/#blade/SamplesExtension/IntrinsicPartsIndexBlade](https://aka.ms/portalfx/samples/#blade/SamplesExtension/IntrinsicPartsIndexBlade).

### Traditional parts and template blades 

Previously, Ibiza blades contained customizable parts, or tiles, that served as the main way for users to navigate the UI. However, the UI's were difficult to navigate, caused excessive navigation, caused excessive horizontal scrolling, and were not very performant.

Newer UI experiences combine traditional menu blades with TemplateBlades to display features and content.

There are still many cases where extensions may display rich monitoring experiences or at-a-glance data. To support those cases, Ibiza now supports multiple, shareable dashboards that were once known as the single start board.

It is highly recommended that developers who still need to build parts should build them for use on dashboards, instead of blades.

### Displaying data by using intrinsic parts

Built-in parts, also known as intrinsic parts, let extension developers create parts that contain pre-defined views and interaction patterns, but lets them plug in their own data.

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory, and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory, based on where the samples were installed when the developer set up the SDK. If there is a working copy of the sample in the Dogfood environment, it is also included.

The following example of a Button part contains an icon and a label that navigates to a blade when the user clicks it. The three files used for the button part example are the following.

*  `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Intrinsic\ButtonPart\ViewModels\ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructionsPartViewModel.ts`

* `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Intrinsic\ButtonPart\ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions.pdl`

* `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Intrinsic\ViewModels\ButtonPartViewModel.ts`

A working copy of the sample is located at [http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions/selectedItem/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions/selectedValue/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions](http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions/selectedItem/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions/selectedValue/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions).

The following procedure demonstrates how to use a button part.

1. Declare the part in the global `<Definition>` section of the PDL for the extension, as in the following example.

     {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/Intrinsic/ButtonPart/ButtonPartIntrinsicInstructions.pdl", "section": "parts#BasicPartExampleForDocs"}

1. The ViewModel that is associated with the pdl will plug data into the part. The ViewModel is located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Intrinsic\ViewModels\ButtonPartViewModel.ts`  For this step, the data is just the label and icon, but for more data-oriented parts, the data can be gathered from a server, like a resource provider. The ViewModel is in the following code.

     {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/Intrinsic/ViewModels/ButtonPartViewModel.ts", "section": "parts#BasicPartExampleViewModel"}

### Custom parts

Unlike intrinsic parts, custom parts use `html` templates that are bound to the view model. The developer defines the look and feel in addition to the data loading for the part. Templates also can use other controls that are provided by the framework, as specified in [top-extensions-controls.md](top-extensions-controls.md).

The following is an example of a custom part. The three files used for the custom part example are the following.

* `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Custom\CustomParts.pdl`

* `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Custom\Templates\ExampleCustomPart.html`

* `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Custom\ViewModels\ExampleCustomPartViewModel.ts`

A working copy is located at [http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/custompart](http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/custompart).

The following procedure demonstrates how to use a custom part.

1. Declare the part in the global `<Definition>` section of the PDL for the extension, as in the following example.

   {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/Custom/CustomParts.pdl", "section": "Parts#CustomPartsPDLDoc"}

1. The pdl points to the html template.

    {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/Custom/Templates/ExampleCustomPart.html", "section": "Parts#CustomPartTemplateDoc"}

1. The HTML template is bound to the following ViewModel by using **Knockout**, which is also referred to in the pdl.

     {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/Custom/ViewModels/ExampleCustomPartViewModel.ts", "section": "parts#CustomPartViewModelDoc"}

### Integrating parts into the part gallery

Tiles are added to dashboards by using the part gallery, which is also known as the tile gallery.  The tile gallery is displayed  when the **Edit Dashboard** command is clicked, or when parts on the dashboard are rearranged or resized.

To register a part with the gallery, you need to add the `PartGalleryInfo` tag inside the `<Part>` or `<CustomPart>` tag, as in the file located at `<dir>\Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/TileGallery.pdl` and in the following code.

   {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/TileGallery.pdl", "section": "parts#PartGalleryDocsPDL"}

The **Title**, **Category**, and **Thumbnail** parts are reasonably intuitive.

Some tile experiences require that parts are configured when they are dropped from the tile gallery. The **AutoConfigSelectablePath** property performs this task for parts that have this requirement.
 
  <!-- TODO: Determine whether the following sentence is more appropriate.
   The **AutoConfigSelectablePath** property set a requirement to configure parts when they are dropped from the tile gallery.
   for parts that have this requirement.
  -->
 
 The following is the path to a selectable that is located inside the ViewMmodel and is immediately set to `true` by the Framework when the part is dropped on a dashboard. The selectable can be configured to open a context blade for configuration. The  example located at `<dir>/Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/ViewModels/GeneralGalleryPart.ts` demonstrates how this type of selectable is configured. The example code is in the following code. 

   {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/ViewModels/GeneralGalleryPart.ts", "section": "parts#PartGalleryConfigOnDropDoc"}

If the part that is being developed is associated with an Ibiza asset like an ARM resource, then it should be associated with an asset type and have a single input definition whose `IsAssetId` property is `true`.  If this is not the case then the part will appear in the **General** category of the part gallery.
 
### Defining the sizing behavior

There is a significant amount of flexibility when sizing extension tiles. All size options are included in the `<CustomPart>` tag in the PDL file located at `<dir>\Client/V1/Parts/PartSizes/PartSizes.pdl`.

A working copy is located at [http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/partsizes](http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/partsizes).

1. The following part supports only the large, standard size.

    <!-- determine why this section stops the gitHub build.-->

    {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/PartSizes/PartSizes.pdl", "section": "parts#BasicPartThatSupportsSingleStandardSize"}

1. The following part supports multiple, standard sizes.

    <!-- determine why this section stops the gitHub build.-->

    {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/PartSizes/PartSizes.pdl", "section": "parts#PartThatSupportsMultipleStandardSizes"}

1. The following part defaults to an arbitrary size, and can be resized by the user.  The Framework automatically adds a drag handle to this part because of the value `ResizeMode="User"`.

    {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/PartSizes/PartSizes.pdl", "section": "parts#PartThatSupportsArbitrarySizeAndUserResize"}

1. The following part defaults to an arbitrary size, and can be resized programatically.  

     {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/PartSizes/PartSizes.pdl", "section": "parts#PartThatSupportsArbitrarySizeAndProgrammaticResize"}

1. The following code demonstrates  how to programatically resize the part from within the associated ViewModel.  The parameters are specified in grid units instead of pixels. The code is located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\PartSizes\ViewModels\PartSizesViewModels.ts`.


      {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/PartSizes/ViewModels/PartSizesViewModels.ts", "section": "parts#ProgramatticResizeDoc"}

### Per user part settings

Extensions can read and write settings that are saved whenever the user saves a dashboard.  Private dashboards are located in the Ibiza user settings service.  Shared dashboards are stored in ARM as Azure resources inside the **MS.Portal** resource provider.

The dashboard is saved as a `JSON` document that contains the list of parts on the dashboard, in addition to their sizes, positions, and settings.  It also contains dashboard-level settings like the time range that is shared by many monitoring charts.

The following example located at `<dir>/Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/TileGallery.pdl` demonstrates the use of the `<CustomPart.PartSettings>` tag to declare settings in the PDL file. It is also in the following code.

   {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/TileGallery.pdl", "section": "parts#PartSettingsDocs"}

The following is the TypeScript code that reads and writes settings. It is also located at `<dir>Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/ViewModels/GeneralGalleryPart.ts`.

   {"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Parts/TileGallery/ViewModels/GeneralGalleryPart.ts", "section": "parts#TileGalleryWithNewConfigurationPattern"}

### The "no data" message

Sometimes parts are displayed for which no data is available. For example, an extension may display a prototype 'deployment history' that contains sample data, previous to the time when the user  enables  deployments for the extension. To support this, part `container` objects use the `noDataMessage` property.

The following example populates the part with sample data and set `noDataMessage` to a non-empty string.

```ts
container.noDataMessage("Enable deployments to see your history");
```

In this example, the part is grayed-out and is non-interactive. The message is displayed on top of the part. To remove the message, set the `noDataMessage` value back to `null`. 

This feature informs the user that the feature exists, although no data is available yet. If the extension needs to disable a part while the  data is loading, it should return a promise from the  `onInputsSet` method or use the `container.operations` queue.

### Pinning parts

By default, all blades and parts are 'pinnable'.  Pinning a part creates a copy of that part on the [dashboard](portalfx-ui-concepts.md#ui-concepts-the-dashboard).  The part on the dashboard provides a shortcut for users, allowing them to get their most used blades, as in the following example.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-ui-concepts/dashboard.png "Dashboard")

All parts are pinnable by default, at little or no cost to the developer.  Part settings are copied to the new part, and the current size is maintained.  The new part is a complete copy of the original part, and can be independently configured, resized, or moved around on the dashboard. 

When a part is pinned or moved to another blade, a new ViewModel for that part is created.  This ViewModel will have the exact same contract.  The inputs to the part are stored in the Portal's cloud settings, and replayed onto the part when the dashboard loads.  For example, the robots part in this sample takes a single input named `id`, which comes from the blade.  When the part is pinned to the dashboard, the blade will obviously not be available, therefore the `id` of the part is stored in persistent storage. The  `id` of the part is in the pdl file located at `<dir>\SamplesExtension\Extension\Client\Hubs\Browse\Browse.pdl`, and it is also in the following code.

```xml
<CustomPart Name="RobotSummary"
            ViewModel="{ViewModel Name=RobotSummaryViewModel, Module=./Browse/ViewModels/RobotSummaryViewModel}"
            Template="{Html Source='Templates\\Robot.html'}"
            InitialSize="FullWidthFitHeight"
            AssetType="Robot"
            AssetIdProperty="name">
  <CustomPart.Properties>
    <Property Name="name"
              Source="{BladeParameter Name=id}" />
  </CustomPart.Properties>
</CustomPart>
```

Model data is not sent in bindings because the extension is required to store specific types of data in persistent storage. The only objects that should be sent as bindings between the extension and the various parts are the keys and ids that are used to load data from a back end server.   If data that specifies the robot changes, like  the name, those changes should be reflected in the part.  This provides the 'live tile' feel of the Portal, and ensures that the part data is not stale.

For more information about keys and data loading in the Portal, see [top-legacy-data.md](top-legacy-data.md).

### Preventing pinning

In some cases, a part should not be pinnable.  Some instances are as follows.

* The part is showing an editable form
* The part is not performant enough to run persistently
* The part should not be displayed in a constrained UX
* The part has no value when pinned

Parts are not individually flagged as not being pinnable.  Rather, a blade that contains those parts is `locked`, as in the sample located at `<dir>\SamplesExtension\Extension\Client\extension.pdl` and in the following code.

```xml
<Blade Name="SamplesBlade"
       ViewModel="SamplesBladeViewModel"
       Pinnable="True"
       Locked="True">
```

**NOTE**:  All parts in the previous `SamplesBlade` will not provide the ability to be pinned.  However, the blade itself can still be pinned, as specified in [portalfx-blades-pinning.md](portalfx-blades-pinning.md).

For more information, about sharing parts, see [portalfx-extensibility-pde.md](portalfx-extensibility-pde.md).


### Versioning

When users customize or pin a part, the following states are stored and used the next time the part is loaded from a customized context.

1. Basic part metadata, like part name or extension name
1. Part inputs, like resource id
1. Part settings, like time range for a chart

Because these states are stored, these parts need to be backwards-compatible.

Supporting new functionality may require the modification of the schema of a part's inputs and settings. 

The Azure Portal always calls the most recent edition of an extension, which is specified in the extensions configuration file. However, older versions of inputs and settings that were stored by earlier editions of an extension may still exist, and they may be incompatible with the most recent edition of the extension. Consequently, users may experience unexpected results when the extension or part is called with previous settings.

Likewise, other extensions may have taken dependencies on less-recent editions of the extension or part. For example, another extension may use a .pde file that contains a `<PartReference/>`.  Those other extensions may also experience unexpected results when they call the extension or part with previous inputs.

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory, and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory, based on where the samples were installed when the developer set up the SDK. If there is a working copy of the sample in the Dogfood environment, it is also included.

This example is based on the sample located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Hubs\Browse\Browse.pdl`. It builds on the ViewModel located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Hubs\Browse\ViewModels\RobotPartViewmodel.ts`.

 The **CanUseOldInputVersion** attribute can be set to `true` to specify that the part can process older versions of inputs. It should be used in conjunction with the  part property named `version`, as in the following example.

    {"gitdown": "include-file", "file": "../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Hubs/Browse/Browse.pdl"}

```xml
<Part Name="RobotPart"
      ViewModel="{ViewModel Name=RobotPartViewModel, Module=./Browse/ViewModels/RobotPartViewModel}"
      CanUseOldInputVersions="true"
      PartKind="Button"
      AssetType="Robot"
      AssetIdProperty="name">
    <Part.Properties>
        <Property Name="version"
                  Source="{Constant 2}" />
        <Property Name="name"
                  Source="{DataInput Property=id}" />
    </Part.Properties>
</Part>
```

**NOTE**: Inline parts can specify the current version as a constant.  Although this is the first explicit version, we recommend using  a value of `2` the first time it is used.

Globally-defined parts can not specify constant bindings, but the flow is mostly the same.

```xml
<CustomPart Name="RobotSummary2"
            Export="true"
            ViewModel="RobotSummaryViewModel"
            CanUseOldInputVersions="true"
            Template="{Html Source='Templates\\Robot.html'}"
            InitialSize="FullWidthFitHeight">
    <CustomPart.Properties>
        <Property Name="name"
                  Source="{DataInput Property=name}" />
        <Property Name="version"
                  Source="{DataInput Property=version}" /> <!-- currently 2 -->
    </CustomPart.Properties>
</CustomPart>
```

  The following code demonstrates how to process explicitly-versioned inputs, in addition to the version of the parts that existed previous to the addition of explicit versioning support.

```javascript
public onInputsSet(inputs: Def.InputsContract, settings: Def.SettingsContract): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
        var name: string;
        if (inputs.version === "2") {  // this block explicitly handles version 2, which is the latest
            name = inputs.name;
        } else if (inputs.version === "1") { // this block explicitly handles version 1, which is now old, but was an explicit version
            var oldInputs: any = inputs;
             name = oldInputs.oldName;
        } else if (MsPortalFx.Util.isNullOrUndefined(inputs.version)) { // this block handles any version of the inputs
            var oldestInputs: any = inputs;                             //  that existed before the version property was added
            name = oldestInputs.oldestName;
        } else {
            throw new Error("Unexpected version.  This should not happen, but there is one edge case where you temporarily deploy a new version, say version 3, and then roll back your code to version 2.  Any tiles pinned before you roll back will hit this block.");
        }
        return this._view.fetch(name);
    }
```

The same technique can be used for part settings as in the following example.

```javascript
public onInputsSet(inputs: Def.InputsContract, settings: Def.SettingsContract): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
        var someSetting: string;
        if (settings.version === "2") {  // this block explicitly handles version 2, which is the latest
            someSetting = settings.someSetting;
        } else if (settings.version === "1") { // this block explicitly handles version 1, which is now old, but was an explicit version
            var oldSettings: any = settings;
            someSetting = oldSettings.oldSetting;
        } else if (MsPortalFx.Util.isNullOrUndefined(settings.version)) { // this block handles any version of the settings
            var oldestSettings: any = string;                             //  that existed before the version property was added
            someSetting = oldestSettings.oldestSetting;
        } else {
            throw new Error("Unexpected version.  This should not happen, but there is one edge case where you temporarily deploy a new version, say version 3, and then roll back your code to version 2.  Any tiles pinned before you roll back will hit this block.");
        }
        return this._view.fetch(name);
    }
```


### Permanently discontinue a part 

Developers occasionally build and ship parts, and later  discontinue their functionality. However, there may be cases where these parts were pinned and  incorporated into the layout of a user's dashboard.

Azure customers have informed the Azure team that parts disappearing automatically from their startboards is an extremely dissatisfactory experience. To address this customer request, Azure has created a process that allows developers to permanently discontinue a part while providing a good user experience that uses customizations.

To discontinue a part, developers delete the majority of the code from the `ViewModel`, but leave the constructor and `onInputsSet`.  in place so that the tile still loads. 

Then use the `container.noDataMessage()` in the constructor to inform the user that the part is no longer supported, and return empty promise from `onInputsSet`.

This ensures that customers are informed that this part is no longer supported, and that parts that fail will not be displayed on their dashboards.  An example is in the following code.

```
export class DocumentCountUsagePartViewModel extends MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Parts.SingleValueGauge.ViewModel {
    constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainerContract, initialState: any, dataContext: DataContext) {
        super();
        container.noDataMessage(ClientResources.tileRemoved);
    }

    public onInputsSet(inputs: any): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
        return Q();
    }
}
```

In the PDL code, make the part global by moving it from inside `<Blade>/<Lens>` tags to be the child of the `<Definition />` tag in the global `*.pdl` file. Then, rename this part, and create a  `<RedirectPart />` tag that uses the old name.
The following example is the code before and after it was rewritten to obsolete the old part.

* Before
    ```
    <Definition...>
        <Blade Name="MyBlade" ...>
            <Lens Name="MyLens" ...>
                <Part Name="DocumentCountUsagePartViewModel"
                    PartKind="SingleValueGauge"
                    ViewModel="DocumentCountUsagePartViewModel"
                    InitialSize="Wide"
                    AssetType="SearchService"
                    AssetIdProperty="resourceId">
                    <Part.Permissions>
                        <PermissionReference AssetType="SearchService" Permission="read"/>
                    </Part.Permissions>
                    <Part.Properties>
                        <Property Name="resourceId">
                            <BladeParameter Name="id"/>
                        </Property>
                    </Part.Properties>
                </Part>
            </Lens>
        </Blade>
    </Definition>
    ```

* After

    ```
    <Definition...>
        <Blade Name="MyBlade" ...>
            <Lens Name="MyLens" ...>

            </Lens>
        </Blade>

        <RedirectPart
            Name="DocumentCountUsagePart"
            Blade="MyBlade"
            Lens="MyLens">
            <NewPart PartType="DocumentCountUsagePartGlobal" />
        </RedirectPart>

        <Part Name="DocumentCountUsagePartViewModelGlobal"
                    PartKind="SingleValueGauge"
                    ViewModel="DocumentCountUsagePartViewModel"
                    InitialSize="Wide"
                    AssetType="SearchService"
                    AssetIdProperty="resourceId">
                <Part.Permissions>
                    <PermissionReference AssetType="SearchService" Permission="read"/>
                </Part.Permissions>
                <Part.Properties>
                    <Property Name="resourceId"/>
                </Part.Properties>
            </Part>

    </Definition>
    ```


**NOTE**: The `<BladeParameter />` element was removed from the `<Property />`  tag because it is not allowed for global parts.

### Removing a part from a blade default layout

An unlocked blade's default layout should consist of tiles that provide the most  value to users and still meet extension performance goals out-of-the-box.  That layout may change over time, and your team may decide that a part that was included in a blade's default layout should be removed.

If the part was defined inline as a `<Part/>` or `<CustomPart>` element within a `<Blade/>` and `<Lens/>`, then the part should be moved out of the blade and into the global part catalog for the extension. Otherwise, if the  part is already defined in the global part catalog, or is defined in another extension, then the pdl file may contain a  `<PartReference/>` tag for the blade, instead of  a `<Part/>` tag.

**NOTE**: It is best practice to use **Typescript** or no-pdl parts.

The following procedure to remove a part from a blade  layout.

1. Remove the  `<Part/>` or `<PartReference/>` tag from the extension configuration or pdl file.

1. If the goal was to permanently discontinue a part, including removing support for pinned instances and the tile gallery, then follow the procedure specified in [#permanently-discontinue-a-part](#permanently-discontinue-a-part). Otherwise, to continue supporting instances of the part that have been pinned to user startboards, or to allow new users to  find the part in the tile gallery,  replace the part tag with a  global definition for  a  `<RedirectPart/>` tag, as in the following xml.  

```xml
<RedirectPart Name="SAME EXACT PART NAME THAT IS BEING REDIRECTED FROM" 
              Blade="EXACT BLADE NAME THAT THE PART WAS DEFINED IN"
              Lens="OPTIONAL - EXACT LENS NAME THE PART WAS DEFINED IN"
              Extension="OPTIONAL - ONLY APPLICABLE IF THE PART IS DEFINED IN A DIFFERENT EXTENSION">
    <NewPart PartType="NAME OF THE NEW GLOBAL PART THAT DEFINES THE PART BEHAVIOR" />

### Handling part errors

Occasionally while loading parts, an extension may encounter an unrecoverable error. In that case, the part may be placed into a failure state, as in the following image.

![alt-text](../media/portalfx-debugging/failure.png "Failed part")

Parts should only be placed into a failed state if there was a system fault and no action can be taken by the user to correct the error. If the user can correct the error, then the extension should display guidance about the error, as in the  example located at `<dir>\Client\V1\Parts\Lifecycle\ViewModels\PartLifecycleViewModels.ts`, and in the following code.

```ts
constructor(container: MsPortalFx.ViewModels.PartContainer, initialState: any, dataContext: DataContext) {
    container.fail(SamplesExtension.Resources.Strings.failedToLoad);
}
```

When the error is  fixed,  then the extension can call `container.recover()` to return the part to its normal display state. One example is that the extension is polling for data, and the first poll does not retrieve results, but a subsequent poll returns valid results.

### Handling assets that no longer exist

Many parts represent assets like ARM resources that can be deleted from the UI, PowerShell, or the calling REST APIs.  A stateless UI system handles this deletion by loading only assets that exist at the time the UI starts up.  Because Ibiza contains the state for all user customizations, this 'Not Found' case is handled in a few specific places. Some examples are as follows.

* A VM part that was pinned to the startboard represents an asset that no longer exists

* The CPU chart for a VM part that was pinned to the startboard depends on information provided by an asset that no longer exists

If this is the case, see [portalfx-extensions-status-codes.md#server-error-404](portalfx-extensions-status-codes.md#server-error-404).

**NOTE**: Instances of 'Not Found' do not count against a part's reliability KPI.
