## Introduction
   
Welcome to Azure! We're excited to have you to join the family and become a partner. If you are developing a service and want your customers to access it by using the Azure Portal, then this is the right starting point. The Azure Portal team supports the Azure Portal, its SDK, and the Framework that service teams use to integrate their management UI into the Azure Portal. 

The Microsoft Azure Portal, located at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), is a central place where Azure customers can provision and manage Azure resources. The Azure Portal is a [single page application](portalfx-extensions-onboarding-glossary.md) that may contain more than one Web application. The parts of the page in the Portal are dynamically loaded based on customer actions.

A UI extension is essentially the user experience (UX) for a service. Extensions are developed by teams that integrate user interfaces into the Azure Portal. Extensions are dynamically accessed and loaded based on customer actions in the Portal.

The portal has an extension model where each team that builds user interfaces (UI) can create and deploy extensions. This process requires a relationship to be established between your team and the Portal team. This document reviews the process of onboarding your team and starting that relationship. 

Onboarding a service, or developing a Portal extension, has three phases: onboarding, development, and deployment. The process is specified in the following image.
