## Introduction

If you are working on an Azure service and want to expose UI to your customers in the Azure portal then this is the right starting point. The portal has an extension model where each team that builds UI creates and deploys an extension. This process requires a relationship to be established between your team and the central portal team. This document walks you through the process of onboarding your team and starting that relationship. 
   
## Step by Step Process overview

Onboarding a service, or developing a Portal extension, has three phases: onboarding, development, and deployment. The process is specified in the following image.

# Phase 1 - Onboarding

## Kickoff Meeting
 
There are lots of docs here. We recommend you send mail to <a href="mailto:ibiza-onboarding-kick@microsoft.com?subject=Kickoff Meeting Request&body=My team would like to meet with you to learn about the Azure onboarding process.">ibiza-onboarding-kick@microsoft.com </a> and request a kickoff meeting. Someone from our team will spend 30 minutes walking through the process at a high level. We can point you in the right direction regarding the latest patterns and practices. We can also answer any questions you have. Finally, we can talk about how the relationship between our teams is managed.

## Onboard with related teams

Onboarding to Azure all up is a big task that spans many teams. The doc you are reading will help you onboard to the portal, but there are many other teams you will need to work with to get your entire service up and running. These include, but are not limited to the following teams:

1. Azure Resource Manager team

     Reach out to <a href="mailto:vladj@microsoft.com?subject=Extension Onboarding">Vlad Joanovic</a> to onboard your resource provider.
    <!--TODO: Locate distribution list for this purpose.  -->
1. Azure Marketing Team

   To ensure that the business goals of the new extension or service are aligned with Azure's business strategy, please reach out to the Integrated Marketing Team or the L&R - Operations - GD&F team at [ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com](mailto:ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com?subject=Azure%20Business%20model%20review). Brian Hillger’s team and Stacey Ellingson’s team will guide you through the business model review process. The extension or service is not ready to be onboarded to Azure until its business model has received approval from those teams. Do not proceed with the next step until the business model has received approval.

1. Support team 

   For integrating with the support system and UX integration.

1. Azure.com team 
   
   For a presence on the marketing site.

1. Billing team
   
   To register meters and other billing related activities.
   
1. AAD onboarding

   Reach out to AAD onboarding if the new extension service needs special permissions besides just calling your own resource provider servers.  If the extension requires additional built-in support for standard Graph or ARM APIs, submit a partner request at the site located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice). 

1. Azure fundamentals and compliance

1. Security and privacy reviews

1. Start the CSS onboarding process with the CSS team at least three months previous to public preview. This process may coincide with the following step. For more information about development phases, see [portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md](portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md).

1. Schedule a UX feasibility review with the Ibiza team UX contact by emailing [mailto:ibiza-onboarding@microsoft.com?subject=Extension%20Feasibility%20Review](mailto:ibiza-onboarding@microsoft.com?subject=Extension%20Feasibility%20Review).  Many extensions have been made more successful by setting up early design reviews with the Azure Portal team. Taking the time to review the design gives extension owners an opportunity to understand how they can leverage Azure Portal design patterns, and ensure that the desired outcome is feasible. 

While the portal team cannot help directly with all of these factors, see [portalfx-extensions-contacts.md](portalfx-extensions-contacts.md) for a list of items with which we can assist you.

For less common scenarios, you might need to do a custom deployment. For example, if the extension needs to reach server services using certificate based authentication, then there should be controller code on the server that our hosting service does not support. You should be very sure that  a custom hosting solution is the correct solution previous to developing one.

## Get the SDK, docs, and samples to your developers

 The [development guide](top-extensions-getting-started.md) located in the main documentation index has all the right pointers.

# Phase 2 - Development

## Develop your extension

 The [development guide](top-extensions-getting-started.md) located in the main documentation index has all the right pointers.

## Learn about the hosting service / plan your deployment strategy

The Ibiza team provides and operates a common extension hosting service that makes it easy to get your extension into a globally distributed system without having to manage your own infrastructure.

## [Deployment using the Ibiza hosting service](portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-overview.md)

For less common scenarios, you might need to do a custom deployment.

For example, if you need to talk to backend services using certificate based authentication then you'll need controller code on the server. This is not supported with our hosting service. You should be very sure you require a custom hosting solution before going down this path. 

Note that you can configure your deployment in such a way that the client portion of your extension uses the hosting service while your custom controller code can be deployed separately.

## [Custom extension deployment infrastructure](portalfx-deployment.md#legacy-diy-deployments)

## Register the extension with the portal product configuration

Once the name of your extension is finalized, it's time to register your extension in all environments. This requires a portal deployment and can take time. Our Service Level Agreements are located at [portalfx-extensions-svc-lvl-agreements.md](portalfx-extensions-svc-lvl-agreements.md).  Please plan accordingly.

* For internal partners, the request to register an extension is a pull request, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-publishing.md](portalfx-extensions-publishing.md).
 
* External teams can submit their requests by reaching out to the <a href="mailto:ibizafxpm@microsoft.com?subject=Onboarding Request: Add <extensionName> to the Portal&body=Extension Name:  <br><br>Company:  <br><br>Brand or Suite:  <br><br>Product or Component:  <br><br> URLs: <br><br>Production: main.<extensionName>.ext.<company>.com<br><br>  Contact info: <br><br>Business Contacts <br><br> Dev leads: <br><br> PROD on-call email for live site incidents: <br><br>">ibizafxpm team</a> with an onboarding request.

* **NOTE**: Extension names must use standard extension name format, as in the example located at [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#name](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#name).

* **NOTE**:  Extension URLs adhere to the naming requirements located in [portalfx-extensions-cnames.md](portalfx-extensions-cnames.md).

* You should enable your extension in all environments. 

# Phase 3 - Deployment

## Release kind

There are three typical release kinds. Private preview, public preview, and GA. For the purposes of deployment public preview and GA are the same. The only difference is that your UI may show preview labels and disclaimers where appropriate. For more information about the three kinds of releases, see  [portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md](portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md).
