## Style: Utility Classes

There are several built-in classes that make working with the portal just a little bit easier.

### Code Formatting

```html
<pre class="msportalfx-code"><code>// this is code</code></pre>
```

In addition to using the `msportalfx-code` class, text blocks may be set to use a monospace style font:

```html
<div class="msportalfx-font-monospace">msportalfx-font-monospace</div>
```

### Utility Classes

```
msportalfx-removepartpadding
```
>Remove default padding on a part template.

```
msportalfx-removepartpaddingside
```
> Remove padding on the side only of a part template.

```
msportalfx-partdivider
```
> Sets up a horizontal side to side divider within the part.

```
msportalfx-clearfix
```
> Applied to a container that contains floated elements, ensures the container gets a size and that DOM element following the container flows the document normally with no overlap.

### Deprecated Classes
