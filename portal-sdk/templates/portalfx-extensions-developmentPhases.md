## Development Phases

### Private Preview
The initial state of extension testing outside the local computer is the private preview. This means that the developer has acquired a small team of reviewers with which to collaborate on the development and testing of the extension.  The developer can then modify the extension until it meets specific criteria for usability, reliability, performance, and other factors.  When those criteria are met, the developer starts the processes that will move the  extension from the private preview state to the public preview state. This process consists of measuring the extension against specific criteria.

<!-- TODO:  If all extensions eventually leave the private preview state, this paragraph can be removed.  The iterative process does not need to be described. -->
<!-- is this item for an code review? -->
An extension that meets the exit criteria can be moved from private preview to public preview.  Not all extensions will be moved to public preview, because factors exist that require that the extension remain in the private preview state.

If an extension will be moved from the private state to the public state, the developer should start the CSS onboarding process at least three months before public preview. This allows the appropriate teams enough time ensure that customers of the extension have access to Azure support and other permissions necessary to access the site. 

The CSS onboarding process requires information like the disclosure level, and the key contacts for the release. When all requirements are met, CSS will release the extension from private preview to public preview.  

For more information about the CSS onboarding process, see [http://spot/intake](http://spot/intake).

### Public Preview

An extension that is in the public preview state can be used by a larger audience than the private preview team and the initial developer.  The icon to the right of the extension      indicates whether the extension is in the private preview state or the public preview state, as in the following image.

In the public preview state, the extension undergoes more development and review, this time with a larger audience.  The criteria that must be met for the extension to leave the public preview state may not be the same as the criteria that were used to validate the extension for the public preview state. 

An extension that meets the exit criteria can be moved from public preview to GA.  The criteria that are used to validate promoting the extension out of the public preview state are located at [Exit Criteria and Quality Metrics](portalfx-extensions-forProgramManagers-exitCriteria.md).

### Global Availability Phase (GA)

When an extension passes all exit criteria for the public preview state, the developer has the option of promoting it to the GA state.
