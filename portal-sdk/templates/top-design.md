# Design patterns for common Azure scenarios

These design patterns provide solutions for common user scenarios in the Azure portal. The framework team establishes design guidelines once several teams have addressed a similar problem, have implemented a well-researched and collective approach to design, and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design patterns to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a consistent experience throughout the Azure ecosystem.
