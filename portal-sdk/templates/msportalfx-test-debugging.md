## Debugging

### debug tests 101

### debugging tests in VS Code

If you run mocha with the --debug-brk flag, you can press F5 and the project will attach to a debugger. 

### Checking the result of the currently running test in code

Sometimes it is useful to get the result of the currently running test, for example: you want to take a screenshot only when the test fails.

```ts

    afterEach(function () {
        if (this.currentTest.state === "failed") {
            return testSupport.GatherTestFailureDetails(this.currentTest.title);
        }
    });

```

One thing to watch out for in typescript is how lambda functions, "() => {}", behave.  Lambda functions (also called "fat arrow" sometimes) in Typescript capture the "this" variable from the surrounding context.  This can cause problems when trying to access Mocha's current test state.  See [arrow functions](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/arrow-functions.html) for details.

### How to take a screenshot of the browser

This is an example of how to take a screenshot of what is currently displayed in the browser.  

```ts
//1. import test fx
import testFx = require('MsPortalFx-Test');
...
    var screenshotPromise = testFx.portal.takeScreenshot(ScreenshotTitleHere);
```

Taking a screenshot when there is a test failure is a handy way to help diagnose issues.  If you are using the mocha test runner, then you can do the following to take a screenshot whenever a test fails:

```ts
import testFx = require('MsPortalFx-Test');
...

    afterEach(function () {
        if (this.currentTest.state === "failed") {
            return testSupport.GatherTestFailureDetails(this.currentTest.title);
        }
    });

```

### How to capture browser console output

When trying to identify reasons for failure of a test its useful to capture the console logs of the browser that was used to execute your test. You can capture the logs at a given level e.g error, warning, etc or at all levels using the LogLevel parameter. The following example demonstrates how to call getBrowserLogs and how to work with the result. getBrowserLogs will return a Promise of string[] which when resolved will contain the array of logs that you can view during debug or write to the test console for later analysis.    

```ts
import testFx = require('MsPortalFx-Test');
...

        return testFx.portal.goHome(20000).then(() => {
            return testFx.portal.getBrowserLogs(LogLevel.All);
        }).then((logs) => {
            assert.ok(logs.length > 0, "Expected to collect at least one log.");
        });

```
