## How to view Live Telemetry

### Using Fiddler

1. Install Fiddler - http://www.telerik.com/fiddler
1. Open Fiddler and configure the "Filters" as below
      ![Fiddler](../media/portalfx-telemetry/fiddler.png)
1. Open Portal and you should see all relevant telemetry logs emitted here.

#### NOTE
  -  If the sign in flow would normally require 2FA (i.e. you are not already signed in), Fiddler will break the sign in flow
  -  Fiddler can capture your passwords

### Using Console Logs
	
1. Enable Console Telemetry - https://portal.azure.com/?feature.consoletelemetry=true# 
1. Hit F12 and view the "Console" Tab.
1. You will be able to see most of all telemetry logs within this window. The only known **Action** that doesnâ€™t show up here is **CreateFlowLaunched**
