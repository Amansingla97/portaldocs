# Design patterns for common scenarios in Azure

Design patterns provide solutions for common problems in a given context.  In Azure, we document these best practices once several teams encounter a problem, design a solution, research that solution and see solid real-world usage results. Azure teams should leverage these design patterns to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

The following patterns are available

# Resource Management
The resource management patterns provide guidance for managing the full lifecycle of Azure resources.

1. Resource Create [top-designpatterns-resource-create.md](top-designpatterns-resource-create.md)
