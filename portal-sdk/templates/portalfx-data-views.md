## Using DataViews

Data in a cache is presented to the `ViewModel` by using a `DataView`. 
The `DataCache` objects contain a `createView` method that is used to create the `DataView`. The data in the cache is processed by the `DataView` that it associates with a specific `ViewModel`. There can be many `DataViews` for a cache but there is a one-to-one correspondence between the `DataView` and the `ViewModel`. Creating a `DataView` does not result in a data load operation from the server.  When a `ViewModel` calls the `fetch()` method for its `DataView`, the method implicitly counts each time a reference is made to each `DataCache` entry. This ref-count keeps the entry in the `DataCache` as long as the blade or part `ViewModel` has not been disposed by the extension.

<!--TODO: Remove the following placeholder sentence when it is explained in more detail. -->

**NOTE**: Because this discussion includes **AJAX**, **TypeScript**, and template classes, it does not strictly specify an object-property-method model.

The example located at `<dir>Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailBrowse\ViewModels\MasterViewModels.ts` demonstrates a `SaveItemCommand` class that uses the binding between a part and a command. This code is also included in the following `WebsiteQuery` example.

```ts
this._websitesQueryView = dataContext.masterDetailBrowseSample.websitesQuery.createView(container);
```

In the previous code, the `container` object acts as a lifetime object that  informs the cache when a given view is currently being displayed on the screen. This allows the Shell to make several adjustments for performance, including the following.

* Adjust polling interval when the part is not on the screen

* Automatically dispose of data when the blade that contains the part is closed

The server is only queried when the `fetch` operation of the view is invoked, as in the code located at 
`<dir>Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailBrowse\ViewModels\MasterViewModels.ts` and  in the following example.

```ts
public onInputsSet(inputs: any): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
    return this._websitesQueryView.fetch({ runningStatus: inputs.filterRunningStatus.value });
}
```

### Observable map & filter

In many cases, the developer may want to shape the extension data to fit the view to which it will be bound. Some cases where this is useful are as follows.

* Matching the contract of a control, like data points of a chart

* Adding a computed property to a model object

* Filtering data that is presented on the client

The recommended approach is to use the `map` and `filter` methods from the library that is located at [https://github.com/stevesanderson/knockout-projections](https://github.com/stevesanderson/knockout-projections).

The `runningStatus` is a filter that is applied to the query to allow several views to be created over a single cache. Each view can present a different subset of data from the cache, as in the code located at 
`<dir>Client\V1\MasterDetail\MasterDetailBrowse\ViewModels\MasterViewModels.ts` and in the following example.

```ts
public onInputsSet(inputs: any): MsPortalFx.Base.Promise {
    return this._websitesQueryView.fetch({ runningStatus: inputs.filterRunningStatus.value });
}
```
