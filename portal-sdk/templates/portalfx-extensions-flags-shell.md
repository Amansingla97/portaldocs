## Shell feature flags

The Ibiza Fx team supports the following Shell feature flags. These flags are only available to the Shell, unless they are configured to be shared. Unless otherwise noted, a value of `true` enables the feature, and a value of `false` disables it. 

<!--TODO: can the canmodifystamps flag ever be required or included when it is false?  -->
<!--TODO: is the canmodifystamps always required when extensionName is used? -->

Shell feature flags are invoked with the syntax: `https://portal.azure.com/?feature.<featureName>=true`.

The keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+D toggles the visibility of the debug tool, as specified in [top-extensions-debugging-overview.md](top-extensions-debugging-overview.md). The yellow sticky that is located at the bottom on the right side of the window can be used to toggle trace mode flags and shell feature flags.

### The extensionName flag

The name of the extension can be used as a feature flag. The extension name can contain any character in the ranges between [a-z] or [0-9]. The portal query string can handle multiple extensions simultaneously.
<!--TODO: Determine whether all uses of the extensionName flag require the 'canmodifystamps` flag. -->
 This flag is used to enable or disable an extension, use a different configuration file for an extension, and provide other run-time functionality.  A value of `true` will temporarily enable a disabled extension, and allows the use of other flags. A value of `false` will temporarily disable the extension and leave it in hidden mode. The syntax for the extensionName flag is `https://portal.azure.com?Microsoft_Azure_DevTestLab=true`. It requires the `canmodifystamps` flag to contain a value of `true` in order to be in effect.  For more information, see [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md).

The name of the extension can be used in the query string to access various Shell flags. These are flags that are independent of the **canmodifystamps** flag.
`   &<extensionName>=true,[<otherShellFlags>]`.  How to use the flags that are within the extension is specified in [portalfx-extensions-feature-flags-developer.md](portalfx-extensions-feature-flags-developer.md);  The Shell flags that require `&<extensionName>=true` are in the following table.
    
  <!--TODO:  Validate that the parameters are used correctly.  -->

  | Directive | Use | 
  | --------- | --- |
  | nocdn | A value of `true` will bypass the CDN when loading resources for the Portal only. A value of `force` will bypass the CDN when loading resources for the Portal and all extensions.|
| testExtensions | Contains the name of the extension, and the environment in which the extension is located. For example, `?testExtensions={"HelloWorld":"https://localhost:44300/"}` specifies the intent to load the `HelloWorld` extension from the localhost port 44300 into the current session of the Portal. The **name** and **uri**  parameters are as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#understanding-the-extension-configuration-in-portal](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#understanding-the-extension-configuration-in-portal).|

    
### The canmodifystamps flag

The **canmodifystamps** flag is used in conjunction with the **extensionName** parameter to pass developer-specified values to the extension, to specify which stage or build number to use, and other purposes. When the **canmodifystamps** flag is set to true, the following run options can be enabled.

* Create custom deployment environments, as specified in [portalfx-deployment.md](portalfx-deployment.md).

* Use a secondary test configuration, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#instructions-for-use](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#instructions-for-use). If the developer is using a secondary test configuration, enter one of the following into the query string immediately after the **canmodifystamps** flag.
 ```js
   &<extensionName>=<stageName>
   &<extensionName>=<buildNumber>
   &<extensionName>=<uriFormatPrefix> 
 ```
  * **extensionName**: The name of the extension.

    * **stageName**:  The stage that represents a datacenter, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading](portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading). Use the name that is deployed to a specific stage, for example, stage1.
    * **buildNumber**:  The build number as specified in [portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading](portalfx-extensions-hosting-service-scenarios.md#sideloading). Replace the dots in the build number with the letter 'd', so that build number 1.0.8.31â€¯is represented by 1d0d8d31.
    * **uriFormatPrefix**: The value to use when building the **uriFormat** string. For example, when **uriFormat** is `//{0}.devtest.ext.azure.com`, the query string `https://portal.azure.com?feature.canmodifystamps=true&Microsoft_Azure_DevTestLab=perf` would cause  the `{0}` in the **uriFormat** string to be replaced with `perf` and attempt to load the extension from `https://perf.devtest.ext.azure.com`.

| desktop | Includes default diagnostics and the desktop entry in the Ctrl+Alt+A popup window | 

**feature.waitforpendingchanges**: Reserved for future use.

**feature.webworker**: Loads the extension in a separate webworker thread, which makes the extension more performant.  The flag is useful for testing extensions previous to enabling them in production. In a webworker thread, objects such as [DOM](portalfx-extensions-flags-glossary.md), cookies, and other items are not available. The query string parameter works in conjunction with the **supportsWebWorkers** parameter in the `extensions.json` file. The  `extensions.json` file must contain the value  `supportsWebWorkers: "true"`, in order for the feature flag to invoke behavior.  When the `supportsWebWorkers` parameter is absent or set to false, the feature flag cannot invoke any behavior. The query string is as follows: `https://portal.azure.com?extName=<webWorkerId>,<extensionName1>=true,<extensionName2>=true, <extensionName3>=true,feature.webworker=<value>`, where

  * **webWorkerId**: Identifies the webworker thread.

  * **extensionName\<number>**: Required field. Matches the name of the extension, without the angle brackets, as specified in the `<Extension>` element in the  `extension.pdl` file.  There is no default that will turn on all extensions in an environment on the basis of the `supportsWebWorkers: "true"` parameter in the json file.
  
  * **feature.webworker**: A value of `true` will allow the extensions to run in the specified webworker. A value of `false` will not run the extensions in a webworker.  In the previous query string, the **feature.webworker** flag allows the webworker whose id is specified in `webWorkerId` to use the extensions named `<extensionName1>`, `<extensionName2>,` and `<extensionName3>`.

    For more information about webworkers, see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

### Marketplace feature flags

<!--TODO:  Determine whether microsoft_azure_marketplace is an extension name or an example extension name.  If such is the case, then the following 4 flags should be documented as only the suffix name. -->

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_Curation**:  Associated with Marketplace extensions. Uses a named curation  . For more information about curations, see   .

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_curation**: Associated with Marketplace extensions. Uses a named curation . For more information about curations, see   .

<!--TODO:  Determine whether microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey is different from microsoft_azure_marketplace_itemhidekey. -->

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_itemhidekey**: Associated with Marketplace extensions. Shows specified Marketplace items that are otherwise hidden, or shows unpublished items in the gallery. A value of `true` shows the item,  and a value of `false` hides it. Used in conjunction with **extensionName** when the extension is enabled. For example, if the hidekey is `DevTestLabHidden`,the following will display the extension in the "Create New" experience while it is enabled.
`https://portal.azure.com?<extensionName>=true&microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=DevTestLabHidden`.

**microsoft_azure_marketplace_quotaIdOverride**:  Associated with Marketplace extensions and the Create Launcher. A value of `true` ,  and a value of `false`.
