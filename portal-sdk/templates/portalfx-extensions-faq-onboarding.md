### SSL Certs

***How do I use SSL certs?***
 
 SSL Certs are relevant only for teams that host their own extensions.  Azure portal ONLY supports loading extensions from HTTPS URLs. Use a wildcard SSL cert for each environment to simplify maintenance, for example,   ``` *.<extensionName>.onecloud-ext.azure-test.net  ``` or  ``` *.<extensionName>.ext.azure.com) ``` .    To simplify overall management when your team is building separate, independent extensions, you can also use  ``` <extensionName>.<team>.ext.azure.com ``` and create a wildcard SSL cert for  ``` *.<team>.ext.azure.com ```. Internal teams can create SSL certs for the DogFood environment using the SSL Administration Web page that is located at [http://ssladmin](http://ssladmin). 
 
  Production certs must follow your organization’s PROD cert process. 

 **NOTE** Do not use the SSL Admin site for production certs.
