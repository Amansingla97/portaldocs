Occasionally, difficulties may be encountered while developing an extension. When that happens, the debug tool that is contained in the Portal can help remove obstacles.  

Other samples and tools are also available to assist in the debugging process.  Any that are not included in the context of the discussion are  included in [top-extensions-samples.md](top-extensions-samples.md).    

Here are a few tips that help get extension development back on track. If you still have questions, reach out to Ibiza team in by using the Stackoverflow tags as specified in [StackOverFlow Forums](portalfx-extensions-stackoverflow.md).

To debug and test your local extension against the production portal, see [portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md](portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md).
