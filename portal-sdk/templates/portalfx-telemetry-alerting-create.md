1. 24-hour create successRate is below {minSuccessRateOverPast24Hours} and 24-hour create totalcount is above {minTotalCountOverPast24Hours}

### Is National Cloud Supported?
Alerts are supported in national clouds. Specify the national cloud portal domain names in "environment" property. You can use the same criteria for national clouds or different set of criteria.The national cloud domain names are "portal.azure.cn", "portal.azure.us", "portal.microsoftazure.de". You can use any legit national cloud domain name, for instance, "aad.portal.azrue.cn".

## How often do they run?

## How do I onboard?

1. Generate the desired per extension configuration
    - This can be done by manually editing the JSON file.
1. Fill out the following work item [https://aka.ms/portalfx/alerting-onboarding][alerting-onboarding] and attach configuration JSON
1. Set up correlation rules in ICM


| Field | Value |
| -----  | ----- |
| Routing ID | 'AIMS://AZUREPORTAL\Portal\\{ExtensionName}' |
| Correlation ID | use table below to map |
| Mode | Hit count (recommended) |
| Match DC/Region | Checked |
| Match Slice | Checked |
| Match Severity | Checked |
| Match Role | Checked |
| Match Instance/Cluster | Checked |


| Alert | Correlation ID |

## How do I know my extension's current customomization?

Click the [this link][alerting-extension-customization] and replace `HubsExtension` with `YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME` and run Kusto function, GetExtensionCustomizationJson. Or go to [https://azportal.kusto.windows.net/Partner][kusto-partner-database] to open Kusto.Explorer and run Kusto function, 
GetExtensionCustomizationJson("YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME"). The regex is supported. You can view alert customization of onboarded extensions. The extension alert customization only exists once you have onboarded to the alerting infrastructure.
> The customizaztion has a daily sync from the SQL database at 5:00 pm PST.

## What happens if I need to update them?
