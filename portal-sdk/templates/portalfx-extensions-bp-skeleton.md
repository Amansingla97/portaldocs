## Best Practices
<!-- Title is required, as a level 2 heading.  If appropriate, the phrase ' for <topic>' can be appended. -->

This document contains best practices that are associated with the topic whose name is a node in the filename. Best practices are procedures other than the typical guidance for the topic or subtopic, and therefore were not mentioned in the overall discussion of the topic or subtopic. They also were not included in a procedure or checklist document for the topic. If there are no best practices for a topic, this optional document can be added when appropriate.

Best practices often result in improved performance, smaller software footprint, increased reusability and maintainability, or similar factors. Some practices are documented in industry practice, like the ***Testing Computer Software*** textbook that is located at [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220689439_Testing_computer_software_2_ed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220689439_Testing_computer_software_2_ed). Although [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.microsoft.com) contains good ideas, it is a forum centered more around answering questions than providing best practices.

In the discussion, mention why these practices are considered best practices, or are good practice for the industry or within software development.  If some of these practices are results of usability studies, a sentence like the following is appropriate.

"This section also includes practices that are recommended based on customer feedback and usability studies."

Descriptions that are in other ***Best Practices*** documents should not be copied into this document.  Instead, summarize the procedure here and use a link to the content  in the other document. In some instances the link is sufficient and does not require an explanation to be added to this document. These links are usually called out with the phrase "For more information, see . . . " and are the last sentence in the section.

### Best Practice Description

The title of the practice should be less than about five words long. The titles, which are H3 headings in HTML, do not need to be numbered.

The description or procedure should be no more than about five paragraphs long, where a paragraph is no less than four sentences.

Each best practice section ends with three asterisks, as in '* * *', to include a separator between topics.
