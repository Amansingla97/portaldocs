## Designing and Arranging the UI

### The section viewModel

While blade templates allow manual layout of controls as specific DOM elements, the generally recommended approach
is to bind a section `viewModel` into the DOM and then add control `viewModels` to the `children` observable array of the section. For example, the following image contains two sections with varying numbers of child objects in their respective arrays.

The section `viewModel` provides default styling for spacing and margins and is an easy way to dynamically add and remove controls.

### The `CustomHtml` control

The `CustomHtml` control can be used to author HTML in an autogenerated layout. Many extensions use these
two controls to avoid having to put much HTML in the blade template. However, placing the controls in the DOM manually is always an option if needed.

To use a section, create a section viewMmodel and bind it into the DOM in the blade template using the `pcControl` binding handler. Then add all the controls that should be displayed into the `children` observable array of the section. This positions the controls sequentially on a blade, by default. 

The section's `style` property can be used to achieve other layouts. This includes table layouts that display controls in multiple rows and columns, as a list of tabs, or as a combination of layouts.

In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory. Links to Dogfood environment are working copies of the samples that were made available with the SDK.

Follow [http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/formsallup](http://aka.ms/portalfx/samples#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/formsallup) and then click on 'Basic Create Form' to view  an example and of basic form creation. The code to create the section is located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\BasicCreate\ViewModels\Parts\FormsSampleBasicCreatePart.ts`.

The following template binds the section into the DOM, and will autogenerate the layout for all of its children.

`<dir>\Client\V1\Forms\Samples\BasicCreate\Templates\FormSampleBasicCreate.html`

{"gitdown": "include-section", "file":"../Samples/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Forms/Samples/BasicCreate/ViewModels/Parts/FormsSampleBasicCreatePart.ts", "section": "forms#section"}
