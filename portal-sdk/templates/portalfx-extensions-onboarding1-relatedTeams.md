### Onboard with related teams

 Teams that are new to Azure development can plan and implement the deployment strategy for new extensions. 
 Onboarding to Azure is a big task that spans many teams that you will work with to get your entire service up and running. These include, but are not limited to the following teams.

1. Azure Resource Manager team 

   For onboarding your resource provider

1. Azure Marketing Team

   To ensure that the business goals of the new extension or service are aligned with Azure's business strategy, please reach out to the Integrated Marketing Team or the L&R - Operations - GD&F team at [ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com](mailto:ibiza-bmr@microsoft.com?subject=Azure%20Business%20model%20review). Brian Hillger’s team and Stacey Ellingson’s team will guide you through the business model review process. The extension or service is not ready to be onboarded to Azure until its business model has received approval from those teams. Do not proceed with the next step until the business model has received approval.

1. Support team 

   For integrating with the support system and UX integration

1. Azure.com team 
   
   For a presence on the marketing site

1. Billing team
   
   To register your meters and other billing related activities.

1. AAD onboarding

   Reach out to AAD onboarding if the new extension service needs special permissions besides just calling your own resource provider servers.  If the extension requires additional built-in support for standard Graph or ARM APIs, submit a partner request at the site located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice). 

1. Azure fundamentals and compliance

1. Security and privacy reviews

1. Schedule a UX feasibility review with the Ibiza team UX contact by emailing [mailto:ibiza-onboarding@microsoft.com?subject=Extension%20Feasibility%20Review](mailto:ibiza-onboarding@microsoft.com?subject=Extension%20Feasibility%20Review).  Many extensions have been made more successful by setting up early design reviews with the Azure Portal team. Taking the time to review the design gives extension owners an opportunity to understand how they can leverage Azure Portal design patterns, and ensure that the desired outcome is feasible. 

1. Start the CSS onboarding process with the CSS team at least three months previous to public preview. This process may coincide with the following step. For more information about development phases, see [portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md](portalfx-extensions-developmentPhases.md).

While the portal team cannot help directly with all of these factors, see [portalfx-extensions-contacts.md](portalfx-extensions-contacts.md) for a list of items with which we can assist you.

For less common scenarios, you might need to do a custom deployment. For example, if the extension needs to reach server services using certificate based authentication, then there should be controller code on the server that our hosting service does not support. You should be very sure that  a custom hosting solution is the correct solution previous to developing one.
