### Develop and deploy the extension
 
1. If the extension requires additional built-in support for standard Graph or ARM APIs, submit a partner request at the site located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice](https://aka.ms/portalfx/uservoice).  For information about other components that the new service needs, see [portalfx-extensions-contacts.md](portalfx-extensions-contacts.md).

1.	Build the extension and sideload it for local testing. Sideloading allows the testing and debugging of the extension locally against any environment. This is the preferred method of testing. For more information about sideloading, see [portalfx-extensions-sideloading-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-sideloading-overview.md) and [portalfx-testinprod.md](portalfx-testinprod.md). 

1. Complete the development and unit testing of the extension. For more information on debugging, see [portalfx-debugging.md](portalfx-debugging.md) and [portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md](portalfx-extensions-testing-in-production.md).


1.	Address the exit criteria to meet previous to moving the extension to the next development phase. The exit criteria are located at [top-exit-criteria.md](top-exit-criteria.md).

1. Create configuration files for the extension as specified in [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md).

1. 	Integrate the extension into the Marketplace. 

    In the following images, each icon in the Azure Portal Marketplace is referred to as a Gallery item. Gallery items take the form of a file with the .azpkg extension. This is a  zip file which contains all assets for the gallery item: icons, screenshots, descriptions.

    * **PROD:** The Marketplace team accepts fully finished .azkpg files from your team and uploads them to Production to onboard the gallery package. Send the following email to 1store@microsoft.com.  The subject line should contain “Marketplace Onboarding Request” and the *.azpkg file should be attached to the email, as in the following image.

    * **DOGFOOD:** Use AzureGallery.exe to upload items to DOGFOOD using the following command:

      ```AzureGallery.exe upload -p ..\path\to\package.azpkg -h [optional hide key]```

    In order to use the gallery loader, there are some values to set in the AzureGallery.exe.config file. For more information, see the Gallery Item Specifications document that is located at      [https://github.com/Azure/portaldocs/blob/master/gallery-sdk/generated/index-gallery.md#gallery-item-specificiations](https://github.com/Azure/portaldocs/blob/master/gallery-sdk/generated/index-gallery.md#gallery-item-specificiations).  

    For more dev/test scenarios, see [https://github.com/Azure/portaldocs/blob/master/gallery-sdk/generated/index-gallery.md#gallery-package-development-and-debugging-testing-in-production](https://github.com/Azure/portaldocs/blob/master/gallery-sdk/generated/index-gallery.md#gallery-package-development-and-debugging-testing-in-production).

### Register the extension

* After deploying the extension to the DOGFOOD (DF) environment, contact the Fx team to request that they enable the extension, if applicable. Every extension  meets required exit criteria / quality metrics before it will be enabled. The  extension will be enabled in production once all exit criteria have been met.
