### Register the extension

Once the name of the extension or service name is finalized, request to have the extension registered in all environments. Registering an extension in Portal requires deployment so it can take several days in the Production environment.  Our Service Level Agreements are located at [portalfx-extensions-svc-lvl-agreements.md](portalfx-extensions-svc-lvl-agreements.md).  Please plan accordingly.

* For internal partners, the request to register an extension is a pull request, as specified in [portalfx-extensions-publishing.md](portalfx-extensions-publishing.md).
 
* External teams can submit their requests by reaching out to the <a href="mailto:ibizafxpm@microsoft.com?subject=Onboarding Request: Add <extensionName> to the Portal&body=Extension Name:  <br><br>Company:  <br><br>Brand or Suite:  <br><br>Product or Component:  <br><br> URLs: <br><br>Production: main.<extensionName>.ext.<company>.com<br><br>  Contact info: <br><br>Business Contacts <br><br> Dev leads: <br><br> PROD on-call email for live site incidents: <br><br>">ibizafxpm team</a> with an onboarding request.

* **NOTE**: Extension names must use standard extension name format, as in the example located at [portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#name](portalfx-extensions-configuration-overview.md#name).

* **NOTE**:  Extension URLs adhere to the naming requirements located in [portalfx-extensions-cnames.md](portalfx-extensions-cnames.md).

* After deploying the extension to the DOGFOOD (DF) environment, contact the  <a href="mailto:ibizafxpm@microsoft.com?subject=Onboarding Request: Enable <extensionName> after DOGFOOD deployment&body=Extension Name:  <br><br>Company:  <br><br>Brand or Suite:  <br><br>Product or Component:  <br><br> URLs: <br><br>Production: main.<extensionName>.ext.<company>.com<br><br>  Contact info: <br><br>Business Contacts <br><br> Dev leads: <br><br> PROD on-call email: <br><br>">Fx team</a>  to request that they enable the extension, if applicable. Every extension meets required exit criteria / quality metrics before it will be enabled. The extension will be enabled in production once all exit criteria have been met.

* You should enable your extension in all environments.
