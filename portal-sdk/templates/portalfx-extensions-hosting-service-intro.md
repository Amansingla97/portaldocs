## Introduction 

Teams that are deploying extensions that use the classic cloud service model typically have to invest significant time  in the following tasks.

* Onboarding to MDS
* Setting up compliant deployments across all data centers
* Configuring CDN and storage
* Implement caching optimizations in their extension.

The cost of setting up and maintaining this infrastructure can be high. 
By leveraging the extension hosting service, developers can host  extensions  in all data centers without investing heavily in the deployment infrastructure. This is the primary reason that more than 50% of Azure  extensions have been  migrated from legacy DIY deployment to the extension hosting service.
