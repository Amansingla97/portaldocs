#### Sideloading friendly names

***Sideloading friendly names is not working in the Dogfood environment***

In order for portal to load  a test version of an extension, i.e., load without using the PROD stamp, developers can append the feature flag `feature.canmodifystamps`. The following example uses the sideload url to load the "test" version of extension.

`https://portal.azure.com?feature.canmodifystamps=true&<extensionName>=test`

The parameter `feature.canmodifystamps=true` is required for side-loading, and 
 **extensionName**, without the angle brackets, is replaced with the unique name of extension as defined in the `extension.pdl` file.
